              to the branch manager. The manager will respond within two working 
              days and advise you how long it will take to investigate the matter. 
              You will receive a written response within the agreed time. If you 
              are still not satisfied, you can write to the Chief Executive and, 
              if required, your complaint can then be referred to the Society's
