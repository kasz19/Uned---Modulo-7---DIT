      <p><STRONG class="redtext">Business objective<br>
		</STRONG>The Society's principal objective is to be a low-cost provider 
		of retail savings and mortgages to an increasing number of customers and, 
		in so doing, benefit the members of the Society and create secure and 
		rewarding employment.</p>
      <p>A fundamental part of this objective is the desire to increase the number 
        of members by providing appropriate products, and levels of customer service, 
        that encourage new members to join and existing ones to remain with the 
        Society. 2001 proved to be highly successful in this respect and both 
        investors and borrowers were able to enjoy the fruits of building society 
        membership.<br>
      </p>
      <p><STRONG><span class="redtext">Benefiting from membership of a building 
		society</span><br>
		</STRONG>Being a building society, the Chelsea doesn't have equity shareholders 
		to whom it would pay dividends. Instead it can use this money to provide 
		better rates to its investors and borrowers. Record mortgage advances 
		and investment inflows confirm the success of this strategy.</p>
      <p><STRONG><span class="redtext">Borrowers</span><br>
		</STRONG>The number of borrowing members increased to 81,800 as gross 
		lending rose to &pound;1,256m - the tenth successive year in which such 
		lending has reached a record level and significantly greater than the 
		Society's natural market share*. This was achieved through a range of 
		competitive mortgage products:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Cashback mortgage continued to be popular and was supplemented 
          by Two Year Fixed Rate products which were in high demand as borrowers 
          sought to take advantage of low interest rates throughout the year.</li>
        <li>The Prospect mortgage yet again proved successful. This product has 
          been tailored to meet the needs of individuals who, for various reasons, 
          have a blemished financial record but whose current circumstances indicate 
          that their difficulties are behind them.</li>
        <li> A series of factors, not least the steady rise in property values, 
          has led to a rise in demand for rented housing. Many have seen this 
          as an opportunity to acquire property as an investment and the Society's 
          Buy-to-Let mortgage has been successful in meeting this demand. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><STRONG class="redtext">Investors<br>
		</STRONG>Whilst borrowers benefited from falling interest rates, 2001 
		was a difficult year for investors: UK interest rates were low and falling 
		and stock markets suffered significant falls in value as global recession 
		loomed and uncertainties abounded following the terrorist attacks in the 
		United States on September 11th.</p>
      <p>Competition for retail savings was intense as investors tried to obtain 
        the most attractive rate of interest against a background of low absolute 
        returns. Nevertheless, the Society's continuing drive to offer interest 
        rates to investors that are generally above the industry average, ensured 
        that retail funds receipts were buoyant with the number of investment 
        accounts increasing by 10% to 488,700. Fixed Interest Rate Bonds and the 
        Society's Mini Cash <ACRONYM title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</ACRONYM> product proved to be particularly popular, as 
        did the Call Direct range of accounts. The latter are operated by telephone, 
        providing investors with both attractive interest rates and the ability 
        to operate their accounts from the comfort of their own homes. </p>
      <p>In uncertain times investors seek security, and the attractions of investing 
        with a building society come to the fore. Membership of the Society provides 
        investors with a secure haven for their money whilst providing the benefits 
        of interest rates that are boosted by not having to pay dividends to equity 
        shareholders.</p>
      <p><STRONG><span class="redtext">Distribution</span><br>
		</STRONG>The Society remains committed to providing members with access 
		to the Society's products and services in ways that suit their personal 
		needs. </p>
      <p>Upgrading of the branch network continued: a new branch was opened in 
        Southampton; the City branch was relocated from Gresham Street to a better 
        site in larger accommodation in Eastcheap; the branch in South Street, 
        Exeter was relocated to larger premises; and four other branches were 
        refurbished. The branch network plays an important role for members who 
        seek to transact on a face-to-face basis. Branch upgrades and the introduction 
        of new branch technology provide a clear signal that the Society is committed 
        to retaining and expanding its branch network. </p>
      <p>Prospective borrowers with no access to the Society's branch network 
        are able to contact our telephone sales team who provide a simple route 
        to purchasing the Society's mortgage products. The telephone, combined 
        with postal facilities, has also been a major force in providing access 
        to retail investment products for investors. The resounding success of 
        the Call Direct distribution channel was testimony to this.</p>
      <p>The Society's use of the internet for customer and business communication 
        has increased steadily. The Board believes, as with any new business proposal, 
        that use of the internet must be supported by a sound business justification 
        throughout the year. Mortgage intermediaries will soon be able to take 
        advantage of an internet facility that will accelerate loan application 
        decisions.</p>
      <p><STRONG><span class="redtext">Financial performance</span><br>
		</STRONG>Another year of record gross lending resulted in a rise in total 
		assets of over 11% to &pound;5.9 billion. </p>
      <p>The Chelsea, unlike its plc counterparts, does not seek to maximise profits. 
        Instead sufficient profits are generated to enable the Society to grow 
        and prosper whilst ensuring that financial stability is maintained. In 
        2001 pre-tax profits were &pound;44.4m, an increase of 2% on the previous 
        year. Interest margins (essentially the difference between the amount 
        of interest received from borrowers and paid to investors) continue to 
        fall throughout the industry and in such circumstances, attention must 
        focus on other sources of income and also on strict cost control. </p>
      <p>For a number of years the Society has achieved consistent growth in non-interest 
        income and 2001 was no exception. Significant improvements in efficiency 
        were also a highlight of the year. The management expense ratio is a key 
        measure of the Society's efficiency in running its business and this ratio 
        fell for the ninth consecutive year from 0.76% to 0.72%. Relative efficiency 
        in generating income is measured by the 'costs-to-income' ratio. In 2001 
        this ratio fell to 46.7%, one of the lowest ratios' in the building societies 
        sector.</p>
      <p><STRONG><span class="redtext">Future developments</span><br>
		</STRONG>The Board's commitment to delivering tangible benefits to members 
		is based on its view that, by remaining a building society, it is better 
		placed to provide competitive retail savings and mortgage rates. The Society 
		will continue its strategy of concentrating on these core building society 
		activities but, in doing so, will develop further non-margin income streams 
		where they relate to the core business. In 2002, for example, a new insurance 
		system will be introduced which will provide increased potential for the 
		sale of a range of insurance products to new and existing customers. </p>

      </table>
      <p>The process of upgrading the branch network will be sustained until all 
        branch offices have been refurbished to the Society's exacting standards. 
        In some cases branches will be relocated to more suitable sites and, where 
        business potential justifies it, further new branches will be opened. 
      </p>
      <p>The Society will strive to provide members with enhanced services, a 
        caring approach and an interest rate advantage that only a building society 
        can offer. These objectives combine to create a powerful position from 
        which to prosper in an increasingly competitive marketplace. The Board 
        is confident that the Society can continue to grow from strength to strength 
        for the benefit of both its members and staff without whom its success 
        would not be possible.</p>
