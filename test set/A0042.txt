              tax</a></span>. If you are a higher rate taxpayer you can claim

              in the pension fund and grows in a tax efficient environment. On 
              reaching retirement, you can normally take part of the fund (up 
              to 25%) as a tax-free lump sum. The remainder is then used to provide 
              an income, which will be subject to <span class="bodybold"><a href="javascript:popUp('../jargon-buster.htm#income-tax')">income 
              tax</a></span>. You can usually have access to your pension fund

            <p class="body">A new simple, flexible and low cost pension will be

            effect on the amount you can pay into a Stakeholder Pension. The maximum

            limit includes all pensions, not just contributions to one
