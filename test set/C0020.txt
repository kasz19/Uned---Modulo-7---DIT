greater than the sum insured shown on your schedule,<STRONG> you
</STRONG>will have to pay a proportionate share of the claim.
For example, if your sum insured only covers two thirds of the
indemnity value of your contents,<STRONG> we </STRONG>will only
pay two thirds of the claim.
<LI>If the sum insured is adequate,<STRONG> we </STRONG>will settle

value of the contents.

pay two thirds of the claim.
<LI>If the sum insured is adequate,<STRONG> we </STRONG>will settle
the claim by either replacing the item or paying<STRONG> you </STRONG>the
