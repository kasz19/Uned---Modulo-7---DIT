            <p><b>4. Your Account</b></p>
            <p> 4.1 We will debit to Your Account the amount of each Purchase 
              and of each Advance. We may be contacted by a retailer or 
              a person acting on its or the retailer's behalf to confirm that 
              it will authorise a proposed Purchase or Advance. Purchases or Advances 
              which are authorised are treated as having been debited to the Account 
              on the date of authorisation and will immediately reduce the credit 
              available on the Account by the amount of the Purchase or Advance. 
            </p>
            <p><b>5. Foreign Currency Transactions </b></p>
            <p>5.1 The amount of any Purchase or Advance in a currency other than 
              Sterling will be converted into Sterling at a rate of exchange determined 
              by the Schemes. In addition, the rate of exchange shown on Your Statement 
              will include an administration levy of 2.75% as explained in Condition 
              7.2. </p>
            <p><b>6. Payment</b> </p>
            <p>
						  6.1 Repayment will take place when repayments are credited to Your 
              Account and will be applied in the following order:<br>
              <ol type=i>
								<li>in payment of all interest, annual fee (where applicable), administration 
              			charges and handling charges shown on any Statement;</li><br>
              	<li>towards repayment of all Advances shown on any Statement;</li><br> 
	      				<li>towards repayment of all Purchases shown on any Statement;</li> <br>
              	<li>towards repayment of any Advance made but not then shown on 
              			any Statement; and</li> <br>
              	<li>towards repayment of any Purchases made but not then shown on 
              			any Statement.</li>
							</ol>
						</p>
            <p>6.2 From time to time, We may notify You of Special Promotions 
              which may include a reduced rate of interest or special terms  
              We may offer for particular transactions or categories of transaction. 
              On these occasions, repayments will be applied towards repayment 
              of Special Promotion Advances and Purchases before the repayments 
              shown in Condition 6.1 (ii) to (v), but in the same order for Advances 
              and Purchases.</p>
            <p> 6.3 We will send a Statement of Your Account ('Statement') 
              to You each month, except where there has been no movement on the 
              Account during the period to which the Statement relates and the 
              balance of the Account is nil. The Statement will detail the minimum 
              sum You must repay and the date by which such repayment must reach 
              the Account. The minimum sum will be the greater of £5 or 5% of 
              the outstanding balance. Where the outstanding balance is less than 
              £5, the minimum sum will be the whole of the outstanding balance. 
              If You wish to query any item on any Statement, You must contact 
              Us immediately. </p>
            <p>6.4 We may give You the opportunity from time to time to 
              take a Payment Holiday. During Payment Holidays, We will continue 
              to work out and charge interest under Condition 7. The Payment Holiday 
              will not extend the period referred to in Condition 7.1 during which 
              You must repay the outstanding balance in full to avoid paying interest. 
            </p>
            <p><b>7. Interest </b></p>
            <p>7.1 With the exception of interest on Credit Card Cheques and Balance 
              Transfers, no interest will be charged on any amount debited to 
              Your Account in respect of Purchases or Advances if the whole of 
              the outstanding balance on a Statement is paid in full and credited 
              to the Account within 25 days of the Statement date. If the full 
              balance is not repaid within the 25 day period, interest is charged 
              at a daily rate on the full balance from the date each Purchase 
              or Advance was debited to the Account until full repayment is credited 
              to the Account. Interest on Credit Card Cheque and Balance Transfer 
              transactions will be charged at a daily rate from the date the transaction 
              was debited until full repayment is made. Interest will be charged 
              each month and calculated on a daily basis. </p>
            <p>7.2 In calculating the <u><b>APR</b></u>, no account has been taken of 
              Our right to vary the interest rate, handling charge or annual 
              fee, which together with the administration levy may be varied on 
              notice to You with Your Statement, or otherwise in writing, by way 
              of notice at our branches and/or advertisement in the national press. 
              On receipt of such notification, You may terminate the Agreement 
              by serving notice in accordance with Condition 16.1. A handling 
              charge of 1.5% (minimum charge £2.00) is payable on each Advance 
              (with the exception of a Balance Transfer for which no handling 
              charge is made) and the <u><b>APR</b></u> for Advances (apart from Balance 
              Transfers) will include the handling charge. In addition, in respect 
              of all foreign currency transactions there is an administration 
              levy equivalent to 2.75% of the transaction value. </p>

              in respect of the Account, and You must return all the Cards to 
              Us having immediately cut in two across the magnetic stripe, if they

              charges. Any goods which you already have under the Agreement, apart 
              from any purchased out of a cash loan, will have to be returned. 
              Such goods should not be used and should be kept safe. (Legal action 
              may be taken against you if you do not take proper care of them.) 
              You can wait for them to be collected from you and you need not 
              hand them over unless you receive a written request. If you wish, 
              however, You may return the goods yourself. You will not, however, 
              be required to hand back any goods supplied to meet an emergency, 
              or which have already been incorporated, for example, in Your home. 
              But you will still be liable to pay for emergency goods or services 
              or for any goods which have been incorporated by You or one of Your 
              relatives.

            <p align="center"><b>IMPORTANT - YOU SHOULD READ THIS CAREFULLY<br>
              YOUR RIGHTS</b></p>
            <p> The Consumer Credit Act 1974 covers this Agreement and lays down 
              certain requirements for your protection which must be satisfied 
              when the Agreement is made. If they are not, the Bank cannot enforce 
              the Agreement against you without a court order.<br>
              <br>
              The Act also gives you a number of rights. You have the right to 
              settle this Agreement at any time by giving notice in writing and 
              paying off all amounts payable under the agreement. If you have 
              obtained unsatisfactory goods or services under a transaction financed 
              by this Agreement, apart from any purchased out of a cash loan, 
              you may have a right to sue the supplier, the Bank or both. Similarly, 
              if the contract is not fulfilled, perhaps because the supplier has 
              gone out of business, you may still be able to sue the Bank. If 
              you would like to know more about the protection and remedies provided 
              under the Act, you should contact either your local Trading Standards 
              Department or your nearest Citizens' Advice Bureau. </p>
            <p align="center"><b>LOSS OR MISUSE OF CARD </b></p>
            <p>If the Card is lost, stolen or misused by someone who obtained 
              it without your consent, you may be liable for up to £25 of any 
              loss to the Bank. If it is misused with your permission, you will 
              probably be liable for ALL losses. You will not be liable for losses 
              to the Bank which take place after you have told the Bank of the 
              theft etc.</p>

            Credit Card Repayment Protector cover automatically ceases at age 
            65.<BR> <B>Fixed-term contract workers</B> are eligible for cover but, in the 
            event of an unemployment claim, the exclusion in the "What is not 
            covered?" section relating to fixed-term contracts may apply.<br>
            If You are <B>self-employed</B>, You can only claim unemployment benefit if

            Your business.<BR> If You are in <B>temporary work</B>, You cannot be covered 
            under this insurance.<BR> Any change in Your employment status may affect 
            Your entitlement to claim. 
            <p align="center"><b>HOW MUCH DOES IT COST? </b></p>
            <p>The cover costs 77p for every £100 shown on Your statement balance. 
              A minimum charge of 15p will be made for outstanding monthly balances 
              of less than £20. No charge will be made if your balance is nil. Premiums

            <p align="center"><b>HOW CREDIT CARD REPAYMENT PROTECTOR WORKS</b></p>
            <p> <ul><li>If You are unable to work due to an accident or sickness, or 
              if You become registered unemployed involuntarily, this insurance 
              can repay 10% of the outstanding balance on the last statement before 
              You became ill or were first advised You were to become unemployed.</li><br>
              <li>Payments continue for each subsequent full month of continuous 
              disability or unemployment. Any two periods of disability or unemployment 
              will be treated as one claim if there are less than three consecutive 
              months of employment between them, providing that for disability 
              claims the disability arises from the same cause. Should a claim 
              change from disability to unemployment or vice versa, it will also 
              be treated as one claim. You cannot claim for disability and unemployment 
              at the same time. A maximum of twelve months' payments will be made 
              for any one claim and once this has been received You will not be

              Your death will be cleared in full.</li> <br>
              <li>Under present UK legislation, all benefits payable are free of taxation
              with the exception of any benefit payable if You die which may be subject 
              to inheritance tax. This situation may be liable to change.</li> <br>
              <li>There is a maximum limit of £7,500 for death cover and £750 per 
              month for any disability or unemployment claim.</li></ul>
