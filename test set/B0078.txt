<br>
<a name="a"></a>
<p class="iph">What is the maximum term over which you will lend money?</p>
<p>We do not generally advise you to borrow money over a term of more than 30
years, however, please discuss your requirement with the mortgage adviser at
either your local branch (see <a href="/servlet/File/site/help/25finder/list.html"> Branch Finder</a> for details) or you can call 0800
548548 and speak to one of our fully qualified advisors.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>

<p class="iph"><a name="b"></a>What is the maximum age for a new borrower?</p>
<p>We do not normally grant a mortgage for a term that extends beyond your normal
retirement age unless you have sufficient income to maintain the payments after
you have finished working.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>

<p class="iph"><a name="c"></a>Will you advise me which mortgage will best suit my requirements?</p>
<p>At the Portman, we do not believe it is possible to offer a full mortgage advice
service on the internet. We will, however, be very happy to provide you with
mortgage advice via the Mortgage Consultant at any one of our branch offices,
(see the <a href="/servlet/File/site/help/25finder/list.html"> Branch Finder</a> section of the website), or you can call 0800 548548 and
speak to one of our fully qualified mortgage advisors.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>

<p class="iph"><a name="d"></a>Does the Portman lend on 'buy to let' property?</p>
<p>Yes. The Society offers a range of
buy to let mortgages via Sun Bank. Sun Bank is a member of the Portman Group and
has become renowned for its expertise within the buy to let market. For more
information see the Buy to Let section of the website, or alternatively call our
Direct Mortgage Centre of 0800 548548 for additional information.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>

<p class="iph"><a name="e"></a>Does the Portman consider mortgages on commercial property?</p>
<p>No, the Society will not lend against the security of commercial premises.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>

<p class="iph"><a name="f"></a>Which properties are suitable for a mortgage?</p>
<p>The majority of habital residential properties can be considered as suitable for
a mortgage advance.<br>
We do not lend on mobile homes or house boats, on freehold flats or flats above
commercial premises or on defective reinforced concrete houses. There are also
limits on the amount we will lend on some other types of unusual properties.<br>
For further information, please contact our Direct Mortgage Centre on
0800 548548.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>

<p class="iph"><a name="g"></a>How much can I borrow?</p>
<p>This depends entirely on your ability to repay the mortgage, taking into account
any other financial commitments you might have. As a general rule, you may
borrow up to 3.25 times your annual income, or 2.75 times your joint annual
incomes if there are two applicants. Advances in excess of these amounts may be
considered; please visit your local branch (see <a href="/servlet/File/site/help/25finder/list.html"> Branch
Finder</a>) or telephone our
Direct Mortgage Centre on 0800 548548 for further details. It is advisable for you
to visit the <a href="/cgi-bin/afford_calc.cgi">Affordability Calculator</a>
on this website before proceeding with
your application.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>

<p class="iph"><a name="h"></a>Can you help me to calculate my monthly budget?</p>
<p>Visit our <a href="/cgi-bin/afford_calc.cgi">Affordability Calculator</a> to calculate your total outgoings, and
compare this with your income.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>

<p class="iph"><a name="i"></a>What happens if interest rates rise?</p>
<p>If interest rates rise we will tell you what your new interest rate will be 
and when it will commence. We will also tell you what your new monthly payments 
will be and when these will be collected. Visit our
<a href="/cgi-bin/afford_calc.cgi">Affordability Calculator</a> to work out the effect of a rise in interest
rates on your monthly budget.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>

<p class="iph"><a name="j"></a>What is the maximum percentage you will lend relative to the purchase price?</p>
<p>Generally the Society will consider advances of up to 95% of the value of the
property. From time to time, more than this may be available for first time
buyers. The maximum advance will be less than 95% where the value of the
property exceeds £250,000. Please ask the mortgage adviser at your local branch
(see <a href="/servlet/File/site/help/25finder/list.html"> Branch Finder</a>) for further details, or telephone our 
Direct Mortgage Centre on 0800 548548 for specific details.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>

<p class="iph"><a name="k"></a>What is a fixed rate mortgage?</p>
<p>A fixed rate means that no matter what happens to interest rates, your mortgage
interest stays the same for an agreed period. However you should note that your
monthly mortgage payment could change as a result of other factors; for example
changes in insurance premiums.</p>

<p>When the fixed rate period is over, your mortgage will change to a different
interest rate. This will usually be either our Standard Variable Rate, or a rate
which is linked to the Bank of England Base Rate. Full details of any follow on
interest rates can be found in our <a href="/cgi-bin/mortgage_select.cgi">Mortgage
Selector</a>. The follow on interest
rate may be higher or lower than the interest rate you've been paying. If the
interest rate is higher, your payments will increase.</p>

<p><b>POINTS TO CONSIDER</b> - If you believe that interest rates are more likely to
rise than fall, and you want the security of knowing that your mortgage will not
be affected by fluctuations in interest rates for an agreed period, then a fixed
rate mortgage is certainly worth considering.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>

<p class="iph"><a name="l"></a>What is a Discounted Rate Mortgage?</p>
<p>A discounted rate mortgage guarantees that you'll pay a set amount below our
Standard Variable Rate for the period of the discount. Our standard rate can go
up and down, but the discount remains fixed during the period. You will need to
budget for an increase in your payments when the discount period ends and the
interest rate changes to our Standard Variable Rate.</p>

<p>Discounts, and the period over which they run, vary from time to time.
Generally speaking, the shorter the discount period, the higher the discounted
rate will be. So, for example, if you opt for a two-year discount, your payments
will be reduced for two years, but not by as much as they would be with a
one-year discount.</p>

<p><b>POINTS TO CONSIDER</b> - Your rate of interest will rise and fall as the general
level of interest rates move, but if you are looking for a period during which
your monthly payments will be lower than normal, perhaps to help you settle into
you new home, a discounted rate mortgage may be what you need.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>

<p class="iph"><a name="m"></a>What is a Capped Rate Mortgage?</p>
<p>Capped rate mortgages are generally linked to our Standard Variable Rate and
are sometimes combined with a discounted rate mortgage. Unlike a discounted rate
mortgage where interest rates can rise or fall freely, a capped rate mortgage
has a ceiling above which the rate you pay will not rise for an agreed period. This ceiling is known
as &quot;the cap&quot;.</p>

<p>If interest rates go above this ceiling, you won't be affected; however if
rates fall below the cap, your rate, being variable, will come down. When the capped rate
period ends, you will pay our Standard Variable Rate which may be higher than
the rate you have been paying. If it is higher, your payments will increase.</p>

<p><b>POINTS TO CONSIDER</b> - If you are uncertain about which way interest rates are
likely to move, a capped rate mortgage gives you the security provided by a
fixed rate (when interest rates are rising) and the benefits of a variable rate
mortgage (when interest rates are falling, if rates fall below the capped
level).</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>

<p class="iph"><a name="n"></a>What is a Cashback Mortgage?</p>
<p>These are generally variable rate mortgages where the benefit of lower payments
that are given in discounted rate mortgages are converted into a single lump sum
which you receive when you take out the mortgage.</p>

<p><b>POINTS TO CONSIDER</b> - The lump sum is yours to spend however you want. It can
help towards the cost of moving or for paying for those little extras you've
always wanted.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>

<p class="iph"><a name="o"></a>What is a Tracker Mortgage?</p>
<p>A tracker mortgage is a variable rate mortgage where the interest rate is linked
directly to the Bank of England Base Rate. So whenever the Bank of England Base
Rate changes, the rate on the tracker mortgage will change within an agreed
period. Please refer to the product information section for more details.</p>

<p><b>POINTS TO CONSIDER</b> - Any change to the Bank of England Base Rate will
be passed on to you in full - both when rates fall and when rates rise.</p>

<div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>

<p class="iph"><a name="p"></a>What references and credit checks do you carry out?</p>
<p>The Portman carries out a credit search on each mortgage application. This
credit check will supply the Society with details of any credit arrangements you
currently have in place, and previous commitments you have undertaken over the
last few years. This information helps the Society to make a lending decision.
</p>

<p>References may also be taken from employers, landlords, existing lenders,
bankers, accountants, as deemed necessary. The Society will only take those
references that it considers absolutely necessary in order to reach a lending
decision. It is always helpful if your mortgage application can be accompanied
by supporting documentation in the form of your last two months' bank
statements, payslips, your latest P60 and your most recent mortgage statement.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>

<p class="iph"><a name="q"></a>What is a Mortgage Risk Fee?</p>
<p>A Mortgage Risk Fee is something which you may have to pay if you are borrowing
more than 75% of the purchase price or property valuation, whichever is the
lower. On some of our mortgage products you will only have to pay a fee if you
are borrowing more than 90%. The fee varies according to the amount you are
borrowing: the higher the loan to value ratio, the higher the fee charged, as
illustrated by the table below.</p>

<table border="0" width="100%" bgcolor="#808080" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="2">

<td width="100%">
<p>If you have to pay a Mortgage Risk Fee, you can decide whether to have it
added to the amount you are borrowing, or to have it deducted. Whichever you
choose, the fee is not refundable, even if you repay your mortgage early.
</p>

<p>If you have the fee added, you will pay interest on it for the life of your
loan. So, for example, if you need to borrow £75,000 to buy your home and the
Mortgage Risk Fee is £500, we will arrange your mortgage for £75,500. From
this, we will deduct the £500 and send the balance to your conveyancer. We will
charge you interest on £75,500.
</p>

<p>If you ask us to deduct the fee from the amount
you are borrowing then, using the same example, your mortgage will be for
£75,000 and you will pay interest on this amount. We will still deduct the
£500 and send the balance of £74,500 to your conveyancer. In order to complete
your purchase, you would then need to make up the shortfall of £500 by paying
this to your solicitor.
</p>

<p>From the Mortgage Risk Fee we may buy an indemnity from an insurance company.
If you fall significantly into arrears we may have to take possession of your
property and sell it. If it sells for less than the amount you owe us, we can
then claim on the indemnity to recover some of the losses. The fact that you
paid a fee, or that we bought an indemnity, will not affect your liability to
repay to us, or any insurer, the full amount of the loss and all legal and other
fees.
</p>

<p>Payment of the Fee will not affect your obligation to repay the mortgage. You may also be required to pay a Mortgage Risk Fee if you apply for a
Homeowners' Loan. You will be advised whether a fee is required when you make
your application.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>

<p class="iph"><a name="r"></a>What are the costs of getting a mortgage?</p>
<p>The costs incurred by buying a house and getting a mortgage can be broadly split
into three parts:-
</p>

<ol type="a">
  <li><b>Mortgage lender.</b> The mortgage lender may charge an acceptance fee. This is
an administration charge, usually added to the loan upon completion, which the
lender charges for setting up the new mortgage. You may have to pay a Mortgage
Risk Fee if you borrow a high proportion of the value of your property. The
Mortgage Risk Fee can also be added to the loan. A funds release fee will be
deducted from the advance.<br></li>
  <li><b>Valuation and Survey.</b> The lender may charge a valuation fee. This is to
cover the costs of sending a valuer to inspect the property and to advise the
lender whether or not it is suitable for a mortgage advance. It is in your
interest to have a more detailed inspection of the property carried out and you
can do this by commissioning either a Home Buyer's Report or a full structural
survey. Please refer to the question relating to Valuation and Survey on this
site.<br></li>
  <li><b>Legal fees.</b> Legal fees can be broadly categorised into the amount you need
to pay your solicitor or licensed conveyancer acting on behalf of both you and
the lender in setting up the mortgage, and the standard disbursements such as
stamp duty that you must pay when buying a property. Your solicitor or licensed
conveyancer will provide you with an accurate breakdown of these charges.</li>
</ol><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>

<p class="iph"><a name="s"></a>What is the difference between a Valuation and a Survey?</p>
<p>Before we can make an <a href="/servlet/File/site/mortgages/05purchase/35jargon.html#ooa"> offer of advance</a> we are required to obtain a written
valuation of your property.
</p>

<p>The Mortgage Valuation is a limited report prepared solely for us to assess
the value of the property for mortgage purposes and to enable us to decide how
much to lend, and on what terms.
</p>

<p>The report is not a survey and we do not ask the valuer to carry out a
detailed examination of the structural condition of the property. For example,
the valuer may not inspect inaccessible parts of the property (such as the roof
space, floors, drains etc.) and there could be defects in the property which are
not reported, but would be revealed by a more detailed inspection. Also, some
points which might be important to you as a purchaser, and which could affect
your decision to buy and the price to pay may not be mentioned because they are
unlikely to affect the adequacy of the property as security for the mortgage.
</p>

<p>Given the limitations of the Mortgage Valuation, we strongly recommend that
you consider obtaining your own, more comprehensive inspection or a structural
survey. You will find two alternative schemes described below:-
</p>

<p><b>Home Buyer's
Report and Valuation</b> - Although not a structural survey, the Home Buyer's Report
and Valuation provides you with a concise report on the state of repair and
general condition of the property. It also provides an opinion of its open
market valuation, which should help you to decide whether or not the price you
have agreed to pay is realistic.
</p>

<p>For Home Buyer's Reports we have agreed through a panel of chartered
surveyors a standard scale of charges they will make for providing you with this
report. These are set out in the table in the section <a href="#t">What does the Portman charge for Home Buyer's Report and Valuation?
</a>
</p>

<p><b>Full Structural Survey</b> - A full structural survey is based on a very detailed
and technical examination of the property and provides a comprehensive report on
its condition. The surveyor will comment on the whole property and will usually
provide a list of any repairs and renovations considered necessary.
</p>

<p>The cost of a full structural survey will be set by the surveyor concerned
and will depend on the purchase price, age, type and size of property.
</p>

<p>Please advise us at the time of application if you require a Home Buyer's
Report or a full structural survey.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>

<p class="iph"><a name="t"></a>What does the Portman charge for a Home Buyer's Report and Valuation?</p>
<p>When you submit your application we will ask you to pay a fee which covers the
cost of the Mortgage Valuation unless the product you have selected provides a
free valuation. If you have also requested a Home Buyer's Report, the fee for
this will normally be collected by us at the same time for passing on to your
surveyor.
</p>

<p>The table below sets out the current scale of fees for private dwellings for
owner occupation.

<p>You are obliged to pay stamp duty if you buy a house that costs more than
£60,000. This is a tax payable to the government when you buy a house. It is
calculated on the whole purchase price and not just the amount over £60,000,
and is on a rising scale.

<p class="iph"><a name="v"></a>What is the Mortgage Code?</p>
<p>We subscribe to the Mortgage Code. This is a voluntary code
that sets minimum standards of good mortgage lending practice, which mortgage
lenders and intermediaries have to meet. The Code is monitored by the Mortgage
Code Compliance Board, which comprises representatives from banks, building
societies and independent consumers. Complaints concerning the general operation
of the Code can be made to the Mortgage Code Compliance Board.
</p>

<p>The Code provides valuable safeguards for you and helps you to understand:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>What information you should be given before you take out your mortgage and</li>
  <li>How your mortgage should be dealt with after it has been taken out</li></ul>
    <p>Choosing a mortgage is likely to be the most important financial commitment
    you make. It is important, therefore, that you fully understand the
    implications.  </p>


<p>Under the Mortgage Code you can choose which of the three levels of service
you want us to provide to help you choose a suitable mortgage. The levels are:
</p>

<ol type="a">
  <li>You can ask us to recommend which of our products we feel is best for you based
on information you've given us about your personal circumstances. This is known
as &quot;<b>advice and a recommendation</b>&quot;. You are under no obligation to
accept our recommendation - the final decision is yours; or<br>
  </li>
  <li>You can ask us to
provide you with information about all of our products so that you can choose
the product that you feel is best for you. This is known as &quot;<b>informed
choice</b>&quot;; or<br>
  </li>
  <li>You can ask us for information about the product you've
already chosen. This is where you've already made up your mind, or someone else
has recommended the product to you or, perhaps, because it is the only product
we offer. This is called &quot;<b>execution only</b>&quot;.</li>
</ol>

<p>We offer service levels (b)
and (c) for Internet and postal applications. If you want advice, and you want
us to make a recommendation, you need to speak to one of our Mortgage
Consultants at one of our branches (see <a href="/servlet/File/site/help/25finder/list.html"> Branch
Finder</a>), or at our Direct Mortgage Centre on 0800 548548.
</p>

<p>Before your mortgage is completed we will confirm
to you in writing which level of service was provided to you and the reasons for
a recommendation where we have given one.&nbsp;
</p>

<p> If a mortgage intermediary has
recommended one of our mortgage products to you, you should ensure that they are
registered to give advice under the Mortgage Code.
</p>

<p>We only accept business from
registered intermediaries. You can check whether your intermediary is
registered, by asking to see their Registration Certificate or by contacting:
</p>

<p>The
Mortgage Code Compliance Board<br>
University Court<br>
Stafford<br>
Staffordshire<br>
ST18 0GN<br>
Telephone: 01785 218200<br>
Fax: 01785 218249&nbsp;
</p>

<p>The intermediary will be responsible
for complying with the Mortgage Code and for telling you if they are receiving a
fee from us for introducing your mortgage to us.
</p>

<p>We do not accept any
responsibility for the advice the intermediary gives you, either about the
product they feel is best for you or the way in which you should repay your
mortgage, even if we have paid them a fee.
</p>

<p>The Code also sets out certain
prescribed information that we are required to provide to help you to select a
mortgage appropriate to your needs.
</p>

<p>As well as subscribing to the Code of
Mortgage Lending Practice, we are also signatories to the Banking Code and the
Association of British Insurers' Code of Practice. You can obtain a free copy of
these codes from any of our branch offices or by writing to us at:

The Offer of Advance is the formal documentation that we send to you when we

    when you submit your mortgage application.<br>
  </li>
  <li>A booking fee may also be required – not all of our products carry a
    booking fee. We only charge this fee on products where we expect to sell out
    quickly and where it is necessary for you to reserve (or ‘book’) the
    funds in advance to avoid disappointment. This cannot be added to the loan

<p class="biph"><a name="Administration"></a>Administration Q&amp;A</p>
<p class="iph"><a name="c1"></a>What is the difference between annual interest and monthly
interest loans?</p>
<p>Annual interest refers to mortgages with annual interest calculations.
Monthly interest refers to mortgages with monthly interest calculations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Interest calculation - Annual Interest Mortgages</b></p>
<p>In the first year we work out the interest on the amount you borrow from the
date your loan is issued to the following 31 December. After that we will work
out the interest on the amount you still owe us at the close of business on 31
December each year.</p>
<p>You should note that monthly payments on a repayment mortgage (made up of
capital and interest) do not reduce the amount of interest payable for the year
because the capital balance on which we work out the interest due is only
adjusted on 31 December each year.</p>
<p><b>Interest calculation - Monthly Interest Mortgages</b></p>
<p>We work out the interest on the amount you borrow from the date your loan is
issued to the end of that month. After that, we work out the interest each month
on the amount you owe us at the end of the previous month.</p>
<p>Each time you make a payment to us, we will first of all deduct the value of
any administration charge incurred in the previous month, for example insurance
premiums. We will then reduce the interest which we have charged during that
month by the value of the interest on the net payment from the day we receive it
to the end of the month. Therefore, the earlier in the month you make your
payments, the less interest you will be charged.</p>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
<p class="iph"><a name="d1"></a>Can I make a lump sum repayment (capital repayment) on my mortgage?</p>
<p>Yes, subject to the terms and conditions that apply to your mortgage. Some of
our products contain a Repayment Fee, which means you may incur an extra charge
for making a capital repayment in the early years of the loan. Please check your
mortgage terms and conditions.</p>
<p class="iph"><b>Annual Interest Mortgages</b></p>
<p>If, in addition to making your normal payments each month, you repay an
additional £500 or more (we call this a 'capital repayment'), we will reduce
the interest that you are due to pay during the year by deducting the interest
on the capital repayment from the first day of the month after you make the
capital repayment to the following 31st December.</p>
<p><b>Monthly Interest Mortgages</b></p>
<p>Any additional payments that you make will reduce the amount you owe us and
generate an interest credit from the day of receipt until the end of the month
and could save you money by paying off your mortgage early.</p>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
<p class="iph"><a name="e1"></a>Can I borrow more money in the future?</p>
<p>If after taking out your mortgage, you wish to borrow more, come and
talk to us about a Homeowners' Loan. Check on the <a href="/servlet/File/site/help/25finder/list.html"> Branch
Finder</a>, and if you live
close to a Portman Branch, make an appointment with the Branch Mortgage
Consultant, who can discuss your application and our lending criteria. If
however, you do not live within the vicinity of a Portman Branch, please contact
our Direct Mortgage Centre on 0800 548548 or&nbsp; please refer to the Borrowing
More section of the site.</p>
<p>Homeowners' Loans can be used for home improvements or almost any other purpose
(there are some restrictions). If you require the loan for home improvement
purposes you can borrow any amount from £1,000 as long as the amount when added
to your outstanding borrowing does not exceed 95% of the total value of your
property. If you are looking for a loan for other purposes then your total
borrowing must not exceed 90% of the value of your property or 85% if capital
raising to buy an investment property.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Homeowners' Loans for non home improvement purposes are not available
if less than £25,500 on monthly interest accounts.</p>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
<p class="iph"><a name="f1"></a>Can I change the method of repaying my mortgage?</p>
<p>A repayment mortgage may be changed to an interest only mortgage once a
request signed by all the borrowers on the account has been received. A £40.00
administration fee must be paid before the change can proceed. The change will
take effect from the first day of the next month. Remember that it will be your
responsibility to ensure that you have a repayment vehicle in place to repay your
mortgage at the end of the term.</p>
<p>An interest only mortgage may be converted to a repayment basis once an
instruction signed by all borrowers on the account has been received. A £40.00
administration fee must be paid before the change can proceed. The change will
take effect from the first day of the next month.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
<p class="iph"><a name="g1"></a>My mortgage has just completed. Why is my first payment so low?</p>
<p>The first payment is the interest charged from the date the funds were
released to the end of that month and any additional days' interest that would
not be collected by normal monthly payments before the end of the year. This
ensures that all interest due for the year is paid.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
<p class="iph"><a name="h1"></a>I make my payments by direct debit - can I change the payment date?</p>
<p>Please contact our Customer Services Contact Centre on 01202 560560. They
will be happy to consider making adjustments to the payment collection date for you.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
<p class="iph"><a name="i1"></a>What are the different methods of repaying my mortgage?</p>
<p>Having chosen the type of mortgage product you want, it's important also to
consider how to repay it. You decide the method that suits you and the length of
time over which you want to repay what you've borrowed. As long as the
arrangements fit our lending criteria, the choice is yours.</p>
<p>We will want to ensure that you can repay what you've borrowed before you
retire or, if the mortgage term extends beyond that date, that you have
sufficient income to continue to meet your monthly payments.</p>
<p>There are two basic mortgage types, a repayment mortgage and an interest only
mortgage.</p>
<p class="iph"><b>A repayment mortgage</b></p>
<p>This is where you repay interest and a portion of the capital each month. Year
by year you will see your mortgage balance reduce and, provided you make the
monthly payments we ask, the loan will be repaid by the end of the repayment
period.</p>
<p>In the early years, most of your payments go towards paying the interest and
it usually takes some time before you start to see a significant reduction in
the amount you owe.</p>
<p>If you choose a repayment mortgage we strongly recommend that you arrange
life assurance to repay the loan, should you die during the period of the mortgage.</p>
<p class="iph"><b>An interest only mortgage</b></p>
<p>With an interest only mortgage, your monthly payment to us represents only the
interest on the amount you have borrowed, and the amount you owe remains
approximately the same throughout the term of the mortgage.</p>
<p>Although your monthly payments to us will be less than on a repayment
mortgage, you will need to make provision for repaying the amount you've
borrowed at the end of the repayment term. There are several different ways of
doing this and the notes below explain how each method works. <b> Before you choose,
we recommend that you take advice from a financial adviser who specialises in
these matters.</b></p>
<p>Portman Financial Services Limited (&quot;PFS&quot;) can provide a free
advice service to help you anticipate both your short and long term financial
needs. An appointment can be made with a financial planning consultant through
your local branch or by calling &quot;PFS&quot; on 01202 560590. &quot;PFS&quot;
is a wholly owned subsidiary of CGNU plc.</p>
<p class="iph">Our monthly interest mortgages are available on either one of
these mortgage types (but not a combination of the two).</p>
<p class="iph">By contributing to an Individual Savings Account (ISA)</p>
<p>You pay an agreed sum, either monthly or annually, into an ISA. At the end of
the term, your loan is repaid from the value of your ISA. ISAs are a
tax-efficient way of saving but the final value of your savings is not
guaranteed and might not be sufficient to repay the full amount you borrowed.</p>
<p>An ISA doesn't include life cover and we strongly recommend that you take out
a separate policy to repay what you owe, should you die within the mortgage
term.</p>
<p class="iph">By using an endowment policy</p>
<p>You pay an amount, usually monthly, to a life assurance company, which buys a
policy designed to repay your loan at the end of the mortgage term. Whether it
does repay the loan, depends on how well the policy has performed. If it 
under-performs, it may not provide enough and you will have to make up the
difference yourself.</p>
<p>It is important, therefore, that you check regularly how well the policy is
performing and satisfy yourself that it will generate enough money to repay your
mortgage.</p>
<p>An endowment policy includes life cover to repay your loan if you die within
the mortgage term.</p>
<p class="iph">By using Personal Equity Plans (PEPs)</p>
<p>If you have savings in PEPs you can also use the cash sums which build up within
the plans towards repaying your mortgage.</p>
<p>PEPs have now been replaced by ISAs, and since April 1999 no further savings
can be made into existing plans and no new plans can be taken out.</p>
<p>Like an ISA, the final value of a PEP is not guaranteed. If the fund into
which you have been saving doesn't grow fast enough or there is a fall in the
value of the stock market which affects your fund, there may not be enough to
repay what you've borrowed and you may have to find the balance from elsewhere.</p>
<p class="iph">By using a personal pension plan</p>
<p>You make regular contributions into a Pension Plan. The amount you borrow is
repaid from the lump sum you are able to draw from your Plan when you retire.</p>
<p>However, by using part of the lump sum to repay the mortgage, there will be
less money left over to provide an income for your retirement. You should
ensure, therefore, that there will be enough in your Pension Plan to repay what
you owe and also to provide you with an income to maintain the standard of
living that you require in retirement.</p>
<p>This is currently a very tax-efficient arrangement because your pension
contributions and the lump sum which you use to repay your mortgage, are both
tax-free. However, this might be affected by any future changes to the tax
treatment of pensions.</p>
<p>We recommend you to take out separate life cover to repay your mortgage
should you die within the mortgage term.</p>
<p class="iph">A few words of warning about interest only loans</p>
<ul>
  <li>All of these plans are generally long-term arrangements and the returns
could be small - possibly less than the contributions you've made - if you were
to cancel early.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Remember that if you cannot repay the mortgage when the term ends, you
will have to carry on making interest payments to us each month.<br>
  </li>
  <li>And finally, it is your responsibility to maintain payments into the
investment plan or life policy you have arranged to repay your mortgage and to
ensure that it continues to provide you with the level of cover you require. We
will remind you annually of the need to check the arrangements you have in
place, but if you are in any doubt you should seek the advice of a Financial
Adviser.</li>

<p class="iph"><a name="j1"></a>Do I receive any tax relief on my mortgage?</p>
<p>No. MIRAS or tax relief for mortgages was withdrawn in April 2000.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
<p class="iph"><a name="k1"></a>What happens if I lose my job?</p>
<p>We understand that your personal circumstances can sometimes change through
no fault of your own. Losing your job, falling ill or losing a partner can leave
you short of money.</p>
<p>Not only do we want to help you buy your home, but we also want to help keep
that roof over your head. If at any time you find it difficult to keep up your
monthly payments, you should contact your local branch office or call our
confidential Customer Helpline free on 0800 212508, Monday to Friday between 9am
and 5pm.</p>
<p>There are many ways we can help you, but the important thing is for you to
contact us as soon as you think there may be a problem.</p>
<p>If you fail to pay two monthly payments we can ask a court to order you to
leave your home so that we can sell it. If the interest rate you are paying is
less than our standard variable rate we can increase it to our standard variable
rate.</p>
<p>If we have to sell your home, we have a duty to take reasonable steps to sell
it for the best price we can reasonably get and we can recover any loss we
suffer from you. You will also be responsible for payment of all costs which we
incur in enforcing our rights and we will add these to your account.</p>
<p>You should strongly consider taking Mortgage Care Insurance to cover you for
accident, sickness or unemployment.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
<p class="iph"><a name="l1"></a>What ongoing charges might apply to my mortgage?</p>
<p>After you have taken out your mortgage you may ask us to provide additional
services that we regard as &quot;non-standard&quot;, for example, providing a
duplicate statement or amending the terms of your mortgage. We may, at our
discretion, charge you for providing these. We will always tell you what the
charge will be before providing you with the service.</p>
<p>You can pay the fee or ask us to add it to your mortgage
account. For annual interest mortgages, if the fee is added to your account we
will not charge you interest on it provided it is paid before 31 December. If it isn't paid by 31 December it will become part of the balance on
which we will charge interest for each year the fee remains unpaid.</p>
<p>For monthly interest mortgages, if the fee is added to your account we will
not charge you interest on it provided it is paid before the end of the
following month. If it isn't, it will become part of the balance on which we
will charge interest for each month the fee remains unpaid.</p>
<p>We may also charge a fee if you wish to switch products after an offer has
been made, but prior to completion.</p>
<p>A tariff of the main charges that currently apply to these services is shown
below. All fees are inclusive of VAT. We will send you an up-to-date list of the
charges with your mortgage statement, which will show any new or amended
charges.</p>

<p>Arrears charges are payable each time arrears arise.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>

<p><a href="/servlet/File/site/contact/15complaints">Click here</a>.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
<p class="iph"><a name="o1"></a>How do you notify people of changes to your standard
variable rate?</p>
<p>Individual notices are issued to all borrowers on variable 
rates.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
<p class="iph"><a name="p1"></a>Do I receive a ‘Mortgage Statement’?</p>
<p class="iph">Annual interest mortgage holders receive an annual statement in
January each year. Monthly interest mortgage holders receive a statement within six
months of the date the loan was issued and then at six monthly intervals
thereafter.</p>
<p class="iph">These statements show the opening and closing&nbsp; balances,
details of interest, the insurance premiums and any other fees that we have
charged and the payments you have made. A summary of the interest rates that
have applied during the period will also be included.</p>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
<p class="iph"><a name="r1"></a>How long will it take for my mortgage to complete?</p>
<p>You can expect your application to be completed in around two months from the
day you apply. Please note that two months is a guideline – it may take less
time, and in some cases, it may take a little longer.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
<p class="iph"><a name="s1"></a>I pay my mortgage by direct debit, if I make overpayments can these be
collected on the same direct debit?</p>
<p>Yes, any overpayments you make each month can also be collected on the same
Direct Debit.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
<p class="iph"><a name="t1"></a>How is the interest on my mortgage calculated?</p>
<p>This is discussed in the <a href="/servlet/File/site/mortgages/05purchase/30terms.html">Terms
&amp; Conditions</a> for each mortgage.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
<p class="iph"><a name="u1"></a>Can I change the method of repaying my mortgage?</p>
<p>Yes. A repayment mortgage may be changed to an interest only mortgage (or 
vice versa) once a request signed by all the borrowers on the account has been 
received. An administration fee of £40 will be charged. We will be happy to 
provide a quote on your new terms. </p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
<p class="iph"><a name="v1"></a>Can I change the term of my mortgage?</p>
<p>Yes, you simply have to write in and tell us. We will be happy to provide a
revised quote on your new terms.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
<p class="iph"><a name="w1"></a>I have completed my mortgage and I now wish to let
for a <b> temporary period</b>, what do I do?</p>
<p>You must seek permission from the Society before letting your property. You
must have had your mortgage with the Society for a minimum of six months, and be
able to satisfy us that the rental income you receive for the property will be
enough to cover your mortgage. Once we have given our permission for you to let
your property, we will add a 1.00% loading to your current interest rate for the
duration your property is let.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
<p class="iph"><a name="x1"></a>I am due to complete tomorrow, when is my first payment due?</p>
<p>Your first full payment will be collected by Direct Debit. This generally 
represents the accrued interest from the date of release of funds to the end of 
the month. The first full monthly payment will be collected on the anniversary 
date of completion. We will then collect
each monthly payment on the same day each month. Where we have arranged your
property insurance, the monthly payments will include the monthly insurance
premiums.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
<p class="iph"><a name="y1"></a>What is accrued interest and when do I have to pay it?</p>
<p>Accrued interest is the interest which is accrued in the month which the loan
is completed. This is paid as a separate payment before your first monthly
payment is due. We will write and tell you the amount of accrued interest soon
after your loan has been completed. We will normally collect this by Direct
Debit not earlier than 10 working days and not later than 15 working days after
completion.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
<p class="iph"><a name="solicitor"></a>Can Portman recommend a Solicitor?</p>
<p>You are free to use a solicitor of your choice but we can give you information about the location of solicitors in your area.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
<p class="qna"><a name="Redemption"></a>Redemption Q&amp;A</p>
<p class="iph"><a name="z1"></a>What happens to my deeds when I have paid off my mortgage?</p>
<p>We offer our borrowers a scheme for the safekeeping of their deeds, known as
the Deedsafe scheme. This scheme is available to customers who currently have
their buildings or buildings and contents insured through the Society, or who
wish to arrange insurance through the Society. This insurance must be paid
monthly by direct debit. The way in which the scheme works is that instead of
fully redeeming the account now, a nominal balance of £1.00 is left on the
account which is non-interest bearing. The Society will continue to hold the
deeds of the property free of charge. If you are interested in this scheme,
please contact us for further information before redeeming your account.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
<p class="iph"><a name="a2"></a>I have made a payment after redeeming my mortgage. Will this be refunded?</p>
<p>If this overpayment was in the form of a standing order or a cheque or cash
and a solicitor dealt with the redemption of your account, the refund will be
sent to your solicitors for them to pass on to you. This is because in most
cases where solicitors deal with redemption of a mortgage the borrowers have
moved house and the Society will not have any record of the new address. If the
overpayment was in the form of a further direct debit payment, this will be
refunded back to your bank account approximately 14 days after the payment was
taken. Unfortunately, this delay is necessary to allow time for the payment to
clear. Your bank may be able to arrange to recall the payment for you
immediately under the terms of the &quot;Direct Debit Indemnity Scheme&quot;.
Your bank will be able to supply you with further details.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
<p class="iph"><a name="b2"></a>Is my mortgage subject to an Early Repayment 
Charge?</p>
<p>If your mortgage is subject to a Repayment Fee, this will be detailed in the
terms and conditions of your mortgage and in any subsequent deeds of variation.
If you are still unsure, please contact our Customer Contact Centre on
01202 560560. Our customer service teams will also be happy to confirm in
writing when any such Repayment Charges expire.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
<p class="iph"><a name="c2"></a>What if I move house? Is my mortgage portable?</p>
<p>Most of our mortgages are portable. If you move house you can transfer the
amount of your mortgage to your new purchase. If you need a larger mortgage, you
can usually borrow the extra on any of our mortgage products available at the
time subject to meeting the terms of the product you have chosen. Please refer to the Mortgage Adviser at your local branch (see <a href="/servlet/File/site/help/25finder/list.html"> Branch
Finder</a>), or telephone our Direct Mortgage Centre on 0800 548548 for full details.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
<p class="iph"><a name="d2"></a>When my policy matures, how is the mortgage paid off?</p>
<p>When your policy has matured, your insurance company will send a cheque for
the maturity amount to us. We will redeem your mortgage and send a cheque to you
with any money that is left over.</p><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>&nbsp;Please
