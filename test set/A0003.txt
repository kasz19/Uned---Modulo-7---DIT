Section 1 - Your Travel Insurance
</font>
<br>
<font class="black">
This policy has been arranged by cahoot and is
underwritten by Financial Insurance Company Limited,
Vantage West, Great West Road, Brentford, Middlesex
TW8 9AG.
<br>
<b>We</b> are required to tell <b>you</b> some important features of
<b>your</b> policy including:
<br>
<b>Policy Document</b>
<br>
This policy document gives <b>you</b> full details of the cover
and the conditions <b>you</b> must satisfy to ensure <b>you</b> are fully
covered. <b>Your</b> policy schedule will show the type of cover
<b>you</b> have chosen. Please read these carefully and call us on
0870 400 4894 if <b>you</b> need any further help and advice.
<br>
<b>Conditions and Exclusions</b>
<br>
There are conditions and exclusions which apply to
individual Sections of the policy and general exclusions
which apply to the whole policy, for example consequential
loss.
<br>
<b>Pre-existing medical conditions</b>
<br>
<b>We</b> will not pay if <b>you</b> cancel or <b>cut short your trip</b> as a
result of any pre-existing medical condition for which <b>you</b>
have received treatment or consultation within six months
prior to buying this policy, if <b>you</b> have received a terminal
prognosis or if at the time of buying this policy, <b>you</b> are on
a hospital waiting list or awaiting the results of any
hospital tests, unless <b>we</b> agreed to cover it in writing
before the <b>trip</b>.
<br>
This policy also contains exclusions relating to persons who
are not travelling but on whose health the <b>trip</b> could
depend and also persons <b>you</b> are travelling with but who
are not insured under this policy. If <b>you</b> need any advice
regarding pre-existing conditions, please call us for advice
on <b>0870 400 4894</b>.

<b>Eligibility</b>

To be eligible for this insurance <b>you</b> must be a permanent
resident of the <b>United Kingdom</b>.

<b>Limit of cover</b>
<br>
Each Section of the policy shows the most <b>you</b> can claim,
but other limits may apply. For example under the Personal
Belongings Section the overall cover is £1,500 but there is a
lower limit for <b>valuables</b> and any one item. Please check
<b>your</b> policy carefully to ensure <b>you</b> have adequate cover.
<br>
<b>Looking after your belongings</b>
<br>
<b>You</b>should take all reasonable care to protect <b>your</b>
belongings and act as if <b>you</b> are not insured. If <b>you</b> do not
do this <b>we</b> may not pay your claim.
<br>

<b>Premium refund</b>
<br>
If <b>you</b> are dissatisfied with this policy or if the policy does
not meet <b>your</b> needs, <b>you</b> may return it within 14 days of
the date of issue and <b>we</b> will refund your premium in full
provided <b>you</b> have not undertaken a <b>trip</b>. <b>You</b> must also
not have made or intend to make a claim.
<br>
<b>Excesses</b>
<br>
Under most Sections of the policy, claims will be subject to
an excess. This means that <b>you</b> will have to pay the first
part of <b>your</b> claim. If <b>you</b> have paid the extra premium for
excess waiver cover, the excess will not apply.
<br>
<b>Duration of Cover</b>
<br>
<b>Your</b> policy schedule will show <b>you</b> when <b>your</b> cover starts
and finishes.
<br>
<b>Complaints</b>
<br>
This policy contains a complaints procedure, which tells
<b>you</b> what steps <b>you</b> can take if <b>you</b> wish to make a
complaint.
<br>
<b>Making a claim</b>
<br>
To help <b>us</b> deal quickly and efficiently with <b>your</b> claim,
please read the claims procedure. This tells
<b>you</b> what documents <b>you</b> will need to support <b>your</b> claim.
Some proof <b>you</b> may need, for example a police report,
<b>you</b> must obtain while <b>you</b> are on <b>your</b><b>trip</b>.
<br>
<b>Medical Emergency</b>
<br>
If <b>you</b> need assistance in the event of a medical emergency,
please contact the Emergency Service immediately.
<br>
<b>Choice of Law</b>

<b>you</b> should obtain from <b>your</b> local Post Office the
Department of Health form T5 which contains forms CM1
and E111 which when stamped by the Post Office will entitle
you to certain free health arrangements in EU countries.
<br>
<b>Renewals</b>
<br>
If <b> you</b> have bought an Annual Multi-trip Policy, <b>we</b> will
send <b>you</b> a renewal notice prior to the expiry of <b>your</b>
policy, in time to allow <b>you</b> to consider and arrange any
continuing cover <b>you</b> may need.
<br>
<b>One way trips</b>

and finishes at<b> your</b> usual <b>home</b> in the <b>United Kingdom</b>.
Cover for one way <b>trips</b> may be arranged up to a maximum
of 17 days and will be restricted to the cover that would

end of the period of insurance.
