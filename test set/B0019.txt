          <br>
          &#149; These are additional conditions to your <b>account</b> if you 
          have an overdraft and must be read in conjunction with the <b>account</b> 
          Conditions (&#147;the <b>Account Conditions</b>&#148;).<br>
          &#149; If your <b>account</b> is overdrawn <b>Debit Interest</b> will 
          be charged on the balance overdrawn from time to time at the <b>Society&#146;s</b> 
          authorised overdraft interest rate unless the agreed overdraft facility 
          is exceeded. While the facility is exceeded interest will be charged 
          on the portion of the overdraft in excess of the agreed limit at the 
          Society&#146;s unauthorised overdraft interest rate.<br>
          &#149; Details of these rates are given in our current <b>Premier Current 
          Account/Albion Cheque Account Tariff of Charges Leaflet</b> and are 
          subject to variation in accordance with the <b>Account Conditions</b>.<br>
          &#149; A monthly usage fee will be charged in any month in which the 
          overdraft facility is used except where the overdrawn balance does not 
          exceed the &pound;100 buffer overdraft facility, in which case there 
          is no usage fee. If the overdraft limit is exceeded in any charging 
          month then the unauthorised overdraft fee will be charged instead of 
          the overdraft usage fee.<br>
          &#149; Details of the <b>Debit Interest</b> rates and the authorised 
          and unauthorised overdraft fees are given in our <b>Premier Current 
          Account/Albion Cheque Account Tariff of Charges Leaflet</b> and are 
          subject to variation in accordance with the <b>Account Conditions</b>.<br>
          &#149; <b>Debit Interest</b>, and any overdraft fees, are calculated 
          monthly on the first of each month. You will be advised on your monthly 
          statement of the <b>Debit Interest</b> and any overdraft fees to be 
          charged to the <b>account</b>. The <b>Debit Interest</b> and any overdraft 
          fees will be charged to your <b>account</b> 21 calendar days after the 
          statement date, or the nearest business day thereafter.<br>
          &#149; You must not exceed the agreed overdraft facility without prior 
          agreement. If at our discretion we pay a cheque or other item issued 
          by you, even though this results in the overdraft facility being exceeded, 
          you must immediately deposit sufficient funds in your <b>account</b> 
          to bring the overdraft facility back within the agreed limit.<br>
          &#149; The <b>Society</b> may reduce or withdraw the overdraft facility. 
          We shall wherever possible give you at least 28 days written notice 
          to repay any overdrawn balance in excess of a revised limit but you 
          must pay back such a balance immediately on demand if we so request.<br>
          &#149; Interest on overdrawn balances is calculated daily on the overdrawn 
          balance of your <b>account</b> and debited to your <b>account</b> monthly 
          in arrears and when the <b>account</b> is closed.</td>
