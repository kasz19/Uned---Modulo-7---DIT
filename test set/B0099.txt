	  <STRONG class="redtext"><a name="InvestmentLimits"></a>Investment limits</STRONG><br>
      The minimum investment needed to open an account with the Chelsea varies 
        depending upon the account terms.
      <p>The maximum permitted investment in the Society by any one investor is 
        &pound;1,000,000 and within that limit a maximum of &pound;250,000 may 
        be held, subject to less than 7 days' notice. Many of the Society's investment 
        products pay no interest if the minimum balance falls below that required 
        as a minimum under the terms of the account. The account terms should 
        be consulted as to whether this provision applies.</p>
      <p></p>
	  <STRONG class="redtext"><a name="Identification"></a>Identification</STRONG><br>
      To comply with banking convention, statutory requirements and as an integral 
        part of prudential management to protect the Society and its customers, 
        we will seek suitable means of identification for each applicant when 
        opening an account at branches and before access to funds is permitted. 
        Please be prepared to produce such items as a passport, driving licence, 
        pension book and other documents such as utility bills.<br>
        <br>
      Certain items, such as library tickets, bus passes and other items which 
      are easily obtained and do not offer a reliable means of proof of identity, 
      may not be accepted by the Society's staff. We carry out additional checks 
      to establish identity where accounts are opened by post. New customers opening 
      accounts by post are asked to provide two or more of the following for each 
      applicant; recent Utility Bill, Income Tax coding notification or demand, 
      recent Council Tax Bill, recent Bank or Building Society statement. Further, 
      due to changes in identification requirements there are additional checks 
      to prove identity. In order to carry out these checks you will be asked 
      to provide your employment details, home and business telephone numbers 
      on the application form. For withdrawals and transfers from one account 
      to another, the Society may also request suitable means of proof of identity.
	  <p>For applications by trustees the society will seek additional information 
        concerning both the settlor and beneficiary and may require additional 
        documentation for either or both the settlor and beneficiary.</p>
      <p></p>
	  <STRONG class="redtext"><a name="Interest"></a>Interest</STRONG><br>
      The date(s) and/or frequency of interest payments are set out in the 
        respective terms and conditions of the investment account. The terms relating 
        to interest calculation and any penalties (where applicable) are also 
        detailed in the account terms and conditions.
      <p></p><STRONG class="redtext"><a name="Notification"></a>Notification of interest rate changes</STRONG><br>
      The Society Standard Investment Account Terms set out how interest rate 
        changes will be notified to investors. The Society uses as a standard 
        means of notification, press notices and notices held on permanent display 
        at all branches of the Society. Branch and press notices detail interest 
        rates for accounts both currently promoted through the Society's branches 
        and those which are not currently promoted. In other situations, the Society 
        may provide investors with individual notification of interest rate changes 
        where the Society determines that it is appropriate or where it is necessary 
        to comply with the Banking Code.
      <p>For those investors who do not maintain contact with their nearest Chelsea 
        branch, details of current interest rates can be obtained by written request, 
        by contacting your nearest branch by telephone and asking for the Investment 
        Helpdesk or by <a href="invest_interestrates.html">clicking here</a>.</p>
      <p>The National Daily newspapers normally used by the Society to notify 
        interest rate changes or, where applicable, changes to account terms are 
        The Daily Mail and The Daily Telegraph.</p>
      <p></p>
	  <STRONG class="redtext"><a name="Statements"></a>Statements/tax deduction certificates</STRONG><br>
      The Society issues to investors a combined Statement/Tax Deduction Certificate 
		annually in April, reflecting interest paid and tax deducted (where applicable) 
		in the preceding tax year. The tax deduction certificate will be required 
		by your Tax Office if you wish to reclaim any tax deducted. Where accounts 
		are closed, the Society issues tax deduction certificates upon request.
	  <p><STRONG class="redtext"><a name="Taxation"></a>Taxation</STRONG><br>
        Subject to the required Inland Revenue certification, interest may be 
        paid gross. The Inland Revenue form R85 is available on request at your 
        local Chelsea office. In the absence of valid certification, interest 
        will be paid after deduction of tax at the applicable rate, currently 
        20%, which may be reclaimed from the Inland Revenue by non-taxpayers. 
      </p>
      <p>In the case of joint accounts interest may be paid entirely gross without 
        deduction of tax, however, all account holders must provide the Society 
        with a valid R85 certificate.</p>
      <p>For joint accounts with no more than two account holders, interest may 
        be paid half net and half gross where only one investor is eligible to 
        certify to receive gross interest. In other circumstances interest will 
        be paid entirely net. The net rates shown in the Society's investment 
        literature and promotional material are illustrative assuming tax at the 
        current applicable rate of 20%.</p>
      <p>Where the tax deducted exceeds an investor's tax liability (if any), 
        a claim may be made to the Inland Revenue for repayment of tax. Individuals 
        who are liable to tax at the higher rate of income tax will have to pay 
        additional tax on their interest to cover the difference between the tax 
        deducted and the higher rate of tax due. Chelsea investors who are not 
        ordinarily resident in the U.K. for tax purposes, will receive interest 
        after the deduction of tax at the applicable rate, currently 20%. Some 
        or all of this tax may be repayable by the Inland Revenue. For further 
        information, contact the Inland Revenue, Claims Branch (International 
        Division), St John's House, Merton Road, Bootle, Merseyside L69 9BB.</p>
      <p></p>
	  <STRONG class="redtext"><a name="Withdrawals"></a>Withdrawals</STRONG><br>
      The terms and conditions of each type of account specify whether or not 
        notice is required and, for accounts requiring notice for withdrawals 
        and transfers, details of interest penalties (where applicable). It is 
        important to remember that withdrawals or transfers are not permitted 
        against the proceeds of any cheque paid into an account within the preceding 
        eight working days. In calculating the number of working days, Saturdays, 
        Sundays, Bank and Public holidays are excluded.
      <p>For accounts where a passbook has been issued and where an account provides 
        for immediate withdrawal the Society's daily &quot;on demand&quot; cash 
        withdrawal limit is &pound;250 per investor and the Society reserves the 
        right to decline to pay larger sums for withdrawal in cash whether or 
        not notice of withdrawal is given, for reasons of security. However, &pound;5,000 
        by cheque may be withdrawn on demand and on production of your passbook 
        at any of the Society's branches. Larger sums by cheque may be withdrawn 
        within a few days. Where withdrawal cheques are issued, it is the Society's 
        practice to issue such cheques crossed A/C Payee. Before effecting withdrawals 
        or transfers from one account to another the Society's staff may require 
        production of suitable means of identification to facilitate a secondary 
        signature check. Suitable items will include; Passport, Driving Licence, 
        a signed Cheque Guarantee or Credit or Debit Card.</p>
      <p>For accounts subject to notice of withdrawal or transfer, or where notice 
        is otherwise given, the transaction will be effected on the due date where 
        the passbook or passbooks and detailed instructions have been provided. 
        In the absence of a specific request from an investor to collect a withdrawal 
        cheque personally from the branch, the Society will despatch the cheque 
        on the due date and send it to the registered address of the investor 
        or in accordance with other instructions provided by the investor, by 
        first class post.</p>
      <p>Where following expiry of notice the passbook or passbooks have not been 
        provided to the Society with detailed instructions from the investor, 
        the notice is treated as lapsed and beyond a seven day period of grace 
        withdrawal or transfer will then be subject to a further period of notice.</p>
      <p>For accounts operated exclusively by post, and where a passbook has not 
        been issued the relevant literature and terms and conditions set out the 
        arrangements for withdrawing funds.</p>
      <p></p>
	  <STRONG class="redtext"><a name="Cheques"></a>Sending cheques through the post</STRONG><br>
      If you send a cheque through the post, it will help to prevent fraud 
        if you clearly write the name of the person you are paying the cheque 
        to and put extra information about them on the cheque. For example, if 
        you are paying a cheque to a large organisation such as the Inland Revenue, 
        write on the cheque the name of the account you want the cheque paid into 
        (Inland Revenue, Account - J Jones). If you are paying a cheque into a 
        bank or building society account, always write on the cheque the name 
        of the account holder (XYZ Bank, Account - B Brown).

	  <STRONG class="redtext"><a name="Transfers"></a>Transfers to new types of investment accounts</STRONG><br>
      You are welcome to transfer from an existing Chelsea investment account 
        to one of our currently promoted accounts, immediately and without penalty, 
        if your existing account:
      <ul>
        <li>does not have a period of notice or penalty for withdrawals; or</li>
        <li>is no longer available to new investors.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But, if your existing investment account is subject to a fixed period 
        of investment (e.g. a fixed rate bond) or has a guaranteed link to Bank 
        Base Rate, transfers may be carried out immediately and without penalty 
        only after expiry of the fixed period or guarantee.</p>
      <p>Please note, some accounts with a guarantee do not have a period of notice 
        or penalty for withdrawals - you may need to check your account terms.<br>
      </p>
      <p></p>
	  <STRONG class="redtext"><a name="Terms"></a>Terms and conditions of accounts</STRONG><br>
      The Society's investment leaflets provide details of terms and conditions 
        of accounts. Should you need any clarification on the terms of the account 
        which you have opened or are contemplating opening, please ask the staff 
        at your nearest Chelsea branch.
      <p>Terms and conditions may be varied from time to time. Changes in terms 
        and conditions will be notified to investors in accordance with the terms 
        and conditions of the account, and in compliance with the Banking Code 
        by either sending written notification to account holders or by notices 
        displayed at all branches of the Society or by press notices in two national 
        daily newspapers.</p>
      <p>If there have been significant changes in any one year the Society will 
        give or send a copy of the new terms or a summary of the changes to account 
        holders.</p>
      <p></p>
	  <STRONG class="redtext"><a name="Joint"></a>Joint accounts</STRONG><br>
      Where accounts are opened allowing fewer than all the account holders 
        to operate the account, upon the death of an account holder the funds 
        will be deemed to be owned by the surviving account holder. Joint ownership 
        may continue through divorce, separation or dispute between the parties. 
        Variation of ownership can be achieved by mutual agreement between the 
        parties or by order of a court.
      <p>Where accounts are opened providing fewer than all the account holders 
        to operate the account, in the event of a dispute, separation or divorce 
        and in the absence of mutual agreement between the parties or order of 
        a court the standing instructions for operation of the account may continue 
        for the authorisation of withdrawals or transfers or other services offered 
        by the Society. However, if a party to a joint account wishes to freeze 
        the proceeds of the account it is necessary to provide a written request 
        to the Society to this effect. Freezing of the account may not apply to 
        certain types of transactions as provided in the terms of the account 
        e.g. payment of personal cheques supported by a cheque guarantee card.</p>
      <p>In the event of failure of the parties to reach agreement the account 
        holder(s) may wish to seek legal advice from a solicitor or consult a 
        Citizens Advice Bureau. Additionally, the account holder(s) may wish to 
        discuss such matters with the Society, for example, to obtain details 
        of any direct debits or standing orders or other instructions held by 
        the Society or other information.</p>
      <p>Where the declaration provided to the Society confirms that the account 
        is established on the basis of joint and several responsibility and the 
        account becomes overdrawn the Society is entitled to seek recovery from 
        either/any holder of that account.</p>
      <p></p>
	  <STRONG class="redtext"><a name="DirectDebits"></a>Direct Debits </STRONG><br>
      If the terms of your account provide for a direct debit service you have 
        the benefit of the Direct Debit Guarantee. The Chelsea leaflet "Direct 
        Debiting. Why not pay the easy way?" is available on request and provides 
        full details of the guarantee.
      <p></p>
	  <STRONG class="redtext"><a name="ATMWithdrawals"></a>ATM withdrawals</STRONG><br>
      If the terms of your account provide for an ATM card withdrawal service, 
        whilst the Chelsea does not levy charges for this service, some banks 
        and building societies may levy a charge when you use their machines. 
        If a charge is levied the ATM screen display will refer to the charge 
        before you use the service. Such charges will, subsequently, be debited 
        to your account.
