			<p><font face="Verdana,geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"><b>No excess or deductible for all computer equipment</b><br>
			The no excess feature means that the cost of all insured losses would be recoverable under the policy.</font>
			<ul>
				<li><font face="Verdana,geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"><b>In the event of an agreed claim, a new replacement unit is supplied</b></font><font face="Verdana,geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"><br>
				Inconvenience and disruption are eradicated &#150; when total loss occurs, equipment of the same specification is supplied without any administrative overhead.</font>
				<li><font face="Verdana,geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"><b>Valid claims are approved within 24 hours</b><br>
				Efficient and fast settlement ensures the lost equipment can be quickly replaced. Because the policy provides specific cover for computer equipment it removes any dispute between the Insured and insurer about the scope of cover.</font>
			</ul>
			<p><font size="2" face="Verdana,geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">If, upon an agreed claim, the end user wishes to replace lost equipment with that of a higher specification, then this is allowable provided such discussions take place between the insured and the equipment supplier. The insurer's liability will be restricted to the value of direct replacement equipment only.</font>
			<ul>
				<li><font face="Verdana,geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"><b>No specialist security requirements</b><br>
				Clients do not have to undertake any enhancements to existing security to conform to the requirements of Complete Computer Cover</font>
				<li><font face="Verdana,geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"><b>Terrorist cover is included as standard</b></font><font face="Verdana,geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"><br>
				Subject to the terms of the policy, loss through terrorist act is now covered up to &pound;100,000</font>
				<li><font face="Verdana,geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"><b>Theft of portable machines</b></font><font face="Verdana,geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"><br>
				Unlike the majority of insurance covers, Complete Computer Cover provides standard cover for portable computers wherever they may be used or located. Such cover applies whether an incident takes place in the workplace, car, home or any other location &#150; including outside the UK. The only major exclusions are thefts from unattended cars where the item was not locked away from view and where equipment has been left in the open unattended. Thefts from a locked boot are covered by the policy.</font>
				<li><font face="Verdana,geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"><b>Absence of forcible entry does not invalidate claim</b><br>
				The majority of policies require the claimant to show evidence of forcible entry or exit for a claim to be considered valid. With Complete Computer Cover this is not a requirement for claim validity- except in respect of thefts from vehicles.<br>
