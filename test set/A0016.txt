              Decision Trees. </span></p>
            <p><span class="body">Decision Trees provide information to help you 
              answer the question: "Would a Stakeholder Pension be a good choice 
              for me as part of my financial planning for retirement?" </span></p>
            <p><span class="bodytitle">What is a Stakeholder Pension? </span><br>
              <span class="body">A Stakeholder Pension is a <span class="bodyItalic">new 
              private pension</span>, it's <span class="bodyItalic">not a State 
              pension</span>. You can get a Stakeholder Pension if your are in 
              employment, a fixed contract worker, self-employed or even not working 
              but able to afford contributions. You can get one from a bank, building 
              society, insurance company, investment company or through a financial 
              adviser. </span></p>
            <p><span class="body">You pay contributions regularly which are invested 
              to build up your own pension fund. You can also pay lump-sum contributions 
              whenever you like. </span></p>
            <p><span class="body">When you retire, you use your fund to buy an 
              &quot;annuity&quot;. The annuity will pay you a regular income during 
              your retirement. That income will depend on the size of your fund 
              and the annuity rates at the time you take your pension. </span></p>
            <p><span class="body">You can't withdraw any money from your fund 
              before you take your pension. But when you take your pension you 
              can choose to have up to 25% of your fund as a tax-free lump sum. 
              </span></p>
            <p><span class="bodytitle">What's new about Stakeholder pensions?

              <span class="body">Stakeholder Pensions must meet the standards

                      <span class="body">Providers of Stakeholder Pensions usually 
                      charge for managing your money. There is an upper limit

                      each year. The charge is taken from your fund. So if your 
                      fund is worth £5,000, a 1% charge would be £50. </span><br>

                      <span class="body">You can contribute regularly or occasionally. 
                      It is always best to make regular weekly or monthly contributions 
                      but you can change the amount. You can pay in as little 
                      as £20, and you can stop paying in without having to pay 
                      any penalty and restart later.<br>
                      <br>
                      If you are employed and your employers provide a Stakeholder 
                      Pension, they may, if you wish, deduct your contributions 
                      direct from your pay and put them into your pension fund.

                      You can take your Stakeholder Pension with you when you

                      at any time if you want to, without having to pay any charges

              be able to contribute more than £3,600 and still get income tax 
              relief, depending on your age and earnings. For example, up to age 
              35 you can contribute up to 17.5% of earnings in any tax year. If 
              you are over 35, there is a scale that allows you to contribute 
              higher percentages of your earnings. The Inland Revenue sets the 
              limits on what you can contribute to a pension scheme. </span></p>

              the current MIG arrangements from 2003. </span></p>
            <p><span class="body">The proposals are designed to alter the present

              <span class="body">Stakeholder Pensions allow contributions as low 
              as £20. But a regular monthly contribution of £20 will not produce 
              a large pension when you retire. And the older you are when you 
              start saving, the less time there will be for your pension fund 
              to grow to something worthwhile. The tables in the Decision Trees

            <p class="bodytitle">What does contracting out of the additional State 
              pension (currently SERPS) mean for me? <br>
              <span class="body">Everyone in employment is automatically included 
              in SERPS unless they decide to leave it. This is called 'contracting 
              out'. If you contract out, you give up any SERPS entitlement and 
              build up a replacement for it in your own private pension arrangement 
              instead. The private pension could be an employer's pension scheme 
              or your own Stakeholder Pension scheme or other personal pension. 
              </span></p>
            <p><span class="body">Some employers' occupational pension schemes 
              contract out all scheme members automatically. Other employers' 
              occupational schemes are 'contracted in' and the scheme pensions 
              are paid on top of any SERPS pensions. If you are in one of these 
              contracted in schemes, you can still decide to contract out. </span></p>
            <p><span class="body">You can also decide to contract out if you are 
              not a member of an employer's occupational pension scheme. If you 
              contract out of SERPS this way, the Inland Revenue will pay a rebate 
              on your National Insurance contributions into your private pension 
              fund. The rebate is invested along with your own pension contributions 
              and you build up a replacement pension for the SERPS pension given 
              up. </span></p>
            <p><span class="body">With Stakeholder and other personal pension 
              schemes, the Government sets the rebate. The rebate is set to give 
              a reasonable chance that the replacement pension will be at least 
              as big as if you had remained in SERPS. There's no guarantee that 
              you'll be better off by contracting out but generally the younger 
              you are and the more you are earning the more you stand to gain 
              if you do contract out.</span></p>
            <p><span class="body"> Contracting out is an important decision and 
              you need to consider all the implications. If you want help with 
              your decision, you should consult a financial adviser. You may have 
              to pay for this help. Or you can ask your Stakeholder Pension scheme 
              provider for a comparison of the SERPS pension you'll be giving 
              up and the possible replacement pension you might get from a private 
              arrangement. </span></p>
            <p><span class="body">Deciding to contract out in one tax year does 
              not commit you to do the same in later years. In fact, it's a good 
              idea to review your decision regularly. You should do this, for 
              example, when the State Second Pension starts in 2002. </span></p>
