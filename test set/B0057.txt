                  In certain circumstances it may be necessary for your Solicitor
                  or Licensed Conveyancer to act, for example for the purchase
                  of an additional share in the property, purchase of additional
                  land or to advise a third party. There may be additional charges,
                  for example if you have a second mortgage with another lender
                  or advice is given to a third party. Please ask for details.
                  In these cases any fees charged by your Solicitor or Licensed
                  Conveyancer will be payable by you. In some cases the Society
                  may require additional searches before completing your further
                  loan. If an additional search is needed you will be advised
                  by the Society's Legal Department. The cost of any additional
                  search is payable by you. </font>

                    If we lend more than 75% of the purchase price or valuation
                    of the property (whichever is lower), your loan will be a
                    high loan to value advance. You will normally be charged a
                    fee for it, called a high percentage loan fee, if you borrow
                    more than 90% of the purchase price or valuation of the property.
                    (If you borrow between 75% and 90% the Society will reimburse
                    the high percentage loan fee to you). The fee charged varies
                    according to the amount of money you wish to borrow. This
                    fee will normally be deducted from the loan prior to completion.

                    We will calculate interest on your mortgage account on a daily
                    basis and further details are given in our leaflet "Mortgages
                    with the Cumberland". We will charge interest on your new
                    loan from the date of completion shown in the Solicitor's
                    Certificate of Title. If you apply for a further loan, we
                    will charge interest from the date on which the money is released.
                    The Society can vary the rate of interest on variable rate
                    loans. The authority to vary interest rates is contained in
                    the mortgage conditions (you will be given a copy of this
                    booklet by your solicitor when you take out your mortgage).
                    The actual interest rate to be charged in future and the timing
                    of any change (either an increase or decrease) is at the discretion
                    of the Society, subject to the provisions contained in the
                    mortgage conditions. Further details of the different types

                    If the Society consents to the property being let whilst it
                    is still in mortgage, the rate of interest will increase to
                    1% above the Society's base variable mortgage rate. If the
                    Society does not consent to the property being let whilst
                    it is still in mortgage, the rate of interest will increase
                    to 1.5% above the Society's base variable mortgage rate. Regardless
                    of whether consent is given or not, if you are still within
                    an early-repayment charge period, any remaining discount or
                    other incentive will be withdrawn and any cashback you have

                    These are loans which are secured on your property, and are
                    usually for the purchase of a car, or perhaps a holiday. This

                    All monthly mortgage payments and insurance premiums must
                    be paid on or before the last day of the month in which they
                    are due. Payments and premiums received after the last day
                    of the month will mean your balance will be higher at the
                    end of the month than it would otherwise have been. Interest
                    will be calculated on the higher balance until we receive
                    a cleared payment. If you pay by cash, direct debit, an internal
                    transfer from a Cumberland investment account or a Cumberland
                    cheque, we will treat your payment as cleared funds on the
                    day you make the payment. If you pay by cheque from another
                    organisation, we will treat your payment as cleared funds
                    on the second Society working day after we receive the payment.
                    For example, if you pay on a Monday, we will treat your funds
                    as being cleared on the Wednesday. If you have chosen to pay
                    by standing order, we will not receive your standing order
                    payment until a few days after it has left your bank or building
                    society account. So, you should make sure your bank or building
                    society sends the standing order payment to us in enough time
                    for it to reach us by the last day of the month. </font></p>
