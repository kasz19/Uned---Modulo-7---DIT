<P>
Each year hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of lost or stolen
property is recovered by the police and not returned simply because
it cannot be properly identified.
<P>
Property marking deters thieves. Identifiable property is dangerous
to handle and difficult to dispose of.
<P>
<IMG SRC="tvscreen.gif" width=148 height=99 ALIGN="left">You need to put on your house/flat
number, plus your postcode. This provides a simple and unique
way of identifying where the property should be returned.
<P>
Items can be permanently marked with your postcode by either :
<UL>
<LI>Engraving or Etching
<LI>Punching
<LI>Ultra Violet Marking.
</UL>

<P>
<B>Record of Property</B> 
<P>
If your property is stolen, can you fully describe it and give
your insurers the serial number?
<P>
By keeping detailed records of valuable items, including the serial
numbers, detailed description, make, model and any special features
you can help us and the police in recovery of the item. Colour
photographs can greatly help.
<P>
There are also other methods of &quot;marking&quot; your property.
This can be by &quot;tagging&quot; and your broker can give you
more information on it.
<H3><A NAME="cycles">Cycles</A></H3>

<P>
Every year around 100,000 cycles are reported stolen. You should
take care where you leave your bike and always lock up.
<P>
You should....
<UL>
<LI>Mark the frame with your postcode. This will help the police
return it if it is found.
</UL>

<P>
<CENTER><IMG width=221 height=193 SRC="bracket.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></CENTER>
<UL>
<LI>Always lock your bike to something that is at least as strong
as the lock.
<LI>Even when the bike is in the garage or shed lock the bike.
Using anchor points is even better.
</UL>

<P>
&quot;D&quot; or &quot;U&quot; solid locks are very strong and
visually effective. There are many makes available. If you use
a cable lock make sure they are of good quality.<HR>

<H3><A NAME="fire">Fire Protection</A></H3>

<P>
In a year some 7,000 people will be injured in domestic fires.
Over 700 people will die.
<P>
<IMG SRC="warn.gif" width=148 height=131 ALIGN="left">According to Government research
fire protection and awareness can drastically reduce this figure.
Gas leaks can cause explosions with horrendous consequences.
<P>
What can you do...
<UL>
<LI>Check wiring, leads, earthing and plugs on domestic appliances
to make sure they are safe.
<LI>Never overload electrical points.
<LI>If you have an old house, the wiring should be checked by
a competent electrical contractor.
<LI>Have chimneys swept at least once a year.
<LI>Make sure that portable heaters cannot be knocked over.
<LI>Be careful when smoking.
<LI>Keep matches and lighters away from children.
<LI>Use a secured fireguard on heaters and fires.
</UL>

<P>
<B>Smoke Detectors</B> <IMG width=185 height=47 SRC="smoke.gif" ALIGN="right">
<P>
These do save lives and are invaluable at night when you're sleeping.
<P>
They simply fit into the ceiling at home and you should have at
least one on every floor. They should meet British Standard BS
5446 and carry the kitemark.
<P>
<I><B>Test them regularly.</B></I> 
<P>
Once a month..
<UL>
<LI>Check the battery by pressing the test button.
<LI>Test the sensor by holding a recently extinguished candle
under the alarm.
</UL>

<P>
Once a year..
<UL>
<LI>Change the battery in the alarm.
<LI>Make a note of the date of the change.
<LI>Vacuum the inside of the alarm to ensure dust does not block
the sensor chamber.
</UL>

<P>
<B>Fire Extinguishers</B> 
<P>
Should meet BS 5423 or BS 6165 and carry the BS kitemark.<IMG SRC="!bslogo.gif" width=55 height=66 ALIGN="left">

<P>
Disposable extinguishers need to be changed every four years.
<P>
This table (click here) shows briefly the types of extinguishers
available and their recommended use.
<P>
NOTE: Always read the instruction before use.
<P>
<B>Fire Blankets<br><br><IMG width=88 height=254 SRC="fireblan.gif" ALIGN="left"> </B>
They are ideal for tackling small fires such as chip pans. Always
read the instructions before use. They need to meet BS 6575.
<P>
<B>Gas Leaks</B> 
<P>
Gas leaks are hazardous and can cause an explosion with devastating
results. Your life could also be in danger.
<P>
In the event of a gas leak :
<UL>
<LI>Do not... Smoke Use naked flames. Turn any electric switches
on or off.
<LI>Do.. Turn off the gas supply. Open all your doors and windows
to get rid of the gas. Call the gas emergency service (this can
be found under GAS in your local telephone directory).

<P>
Leaking pipes and tanks often cause damage costing thousands of
pounds especially if the house is unoccupied and leaks aren't
noticed.
<P>
Under 1989 Water Authority bye-laws you can be fined if you allow
pipes to freeze and cause water wastage.
<P>
Here are some measures you can take to avoid this type of damage.
<UL>
<LI>Replace washers and dripping taps.
<LI>Make sure your water stop valve works easily.
<LI>Make sure pipes and tanks are adequately lagged.
<LI>Keep central heating on in cold weather especially at night
to prevent the pipes freezing.
<LI>If your home is going to be empty for up to 30 days between
September and March, keep the heating on at 15&ucirc;C (60&ucirc;F)
or more to prevent the water pipes freezing.
<LI>If your home is going to be empty for more than 30 days between
September and March and you don't want to leave the heating on,
you should turn off the water supply at the mains and drain the
tank and central heating system.
</UL>

<P>
<B>Tanks</B> 
<P>
Tanks need at least 25mm (1 inch) thickness of lagging as shown
above. Tanks sitting on low plinths on the loft floor should be
lagged on the top and down the sides to the floor.
<P>
For large open tanks, 50mm or 2 inch thick material may be needed.
<P>
The floor space immediately below your tank should not be insulated
so that heat will rise from the room below. Alternatively, the
loft door can be left slightly open so that warm air can circulate
around the loft. An elevated central heating tank, often held
on a bracket 1 metre (3 feet) above the floor, will need cocooning
top, sides and bottom. <A HREF="tanklag.htm">Click here for an illustration.</A>

<P>
Suitable lagging for tanks are:
<UL>
<LI>Bags of glass-fibre matting or wool.
<LI>Polystyrene foam rigid sheeting.
<LI>Lagging is available from most DIY stores to fit many tank
shapes.
</UL>

<P>
<B>Pipes</B> 
<P>
You can buy pipe lagging from most DIY stores and it is simple
to fit.<IMG SRC="pipe.gif" width=148 height=209 ALIGN="right"> 
<P>
Pipe lagging should be at least 32mm (1 1/4&quot;) thick and there
should be no gaps. Wind blowing under roof eaves can still freeze
the pipe.
<P>
Types of pipe lagging are:
<UL>
<LI>Polyethylene foam semi-rigid sections.
<LI>Foamed rubber and polyurethane flexible sections.
<LI>Glass fibre and mineral wool rigid sections with aluminium
to prevent condensation.
</UL>

<P>
<B>What to do if your pipes freeze</B> 
<UL>
<LI>Turn off the main STOP valve
<LI>Protect items that are under the frozen pipe, in case it bursts
<LI>Apply heat gradually by using hot water bottles, hair dryers
and fan heaters (be careful with electrical appliances in a damp
environment)
<LI>Do not use blow torches, hot air paint strippers or naked
flames.
</UL>

<P>
Keeping your property in good condition with regular maintenance
will mean that your home is less susceptible to damage in a storm.
<P>
Such actions that can lessen the chance of damage are :Clear gutters
and drains - make sure they are not blocked. Secure any outdoor
items or place them in a garage or shed. Ensure roof tiles are
secure. Flat roofs should be regularly checked. Remember flat
roofs should be replaced every 10 years.
<P>
<IMG SRC="floodsgn.gif" width=150 height=133 ALIGN="left"><B>Flooding</B> 
<P>
<I>If you receive a flood warning:</I> 
<P>
Move everything upstairs. Particular items you should have are;
food, warm clothing, drinking water, a battery radio and a torch.
<P>
Do not use electricity or gas or drink tap water until the &quot;all
clear&quot; sign is given.
<P>
<I>After a flood:</I> 
<P>
Once advised, we will be able to help you with advice on minimising
your loss and returning your home back to normal. The main thing
is to remember is that you must dry out your home properly and
this could take months.
