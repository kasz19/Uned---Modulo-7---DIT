                  Ansvar have always made it a cornerstone of their ethical positioning 
                  to associate with responsible lifestyles and to give tangible 
                  support to organisations which work to reduce the harm that 
                  alcohol and drugs do in society.<br>
                  <br>
                  Today&#146;s rapidly changing and competitive business climate 
                  perhaps leaves little room for sentiment but this philosophy 
                  remains in force today&#133;as demonstrated by these two examples 
                  of current sponsorship projects.<br>

                  <b>Ansvar have announced that they are to sponsor The Global 
                  Rock Challenge in 2001.</b><br>
                  <br>
                  Established in Australia in 1980, the Challenge addresses the 
                  most emotive social issues of the day&#133;by delivering healthy 
                  lifestyle, drug free and crime prevention messages to the heart 
                  of the teenage culture. The core message is that young people 
                  can have a great time without recourse to artificial stimulants.<br>
                  <br>
                  The Challenge is a national inter-schools competition capturing 
                  the imagination of young people by enabling them to use music, 
                  dance, costumes and media images familiar to young people and 
                  perform to professional standards.<br>
                  <br>
                  With 120 area competitions throughout the UK involving over 
                  10,000 students, the event culminates in two regional finals 
                  at the Sheffield Arena and the Albert Hall in May 2001. Previousl 
                  sponsors of the UK Challenge have included BT and Wella Haircare.<br>
                  <br>
                  Ansvar&#146;s General Manager Paul Godfrey commented: &#147;With 
                  extensive media coverage at local and national level, there 
                  is no doubt that this sponsorship is a sound commercial proposition. 
                  But more important is that the aims of the Challenge are in 
                  total harmony with our ethical stance and declared intention 
                  of supporting organisations who work hard to reduce the damaging 
                  effects of drug and alcohol in society.&#148;<br>

                  In the last issue of Ansvar News we reported that Ansvar had 
                  become th main sponsor for the Global Rock Challenge. Essentially 
                  this is a performing arts national inter-schools competition 
                  organised by the charity &#147;Be Your Best Foundation&#148;. 
                  The objective is to promote healthy lifestyle messages to school 
                  teenagers.<br>
                  <br>
                  The regional events are already under way in theatres and other 
                  large venues across the country.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Ian Sadler, Ansvar Field Operations Manager, reports on this 
                  years competition.</b><br>
                  <br>
                  I am very excited about Ansvar&#146;s involvement with this 
                  worthy project. Ansvar are the main sponsor and are given a 
                  very high profile with large banners on prominent display promoting 
                  the Ansvar name. Other sponsors include Panasonic, Wella, Daihatsu, 
                  Sewing World.<br>
                  <br>
                  The main aim of Rock Challenge is to demonstrate that young 
                  people can have a great time without the need for drugs or alcohol 
                  and it is good to see some kids mention this when they are interviewed 
                  after their performances.<br>
                  <br>
                  Each presentation is 8 minutes ling and the school act and dance 
                  to a soundtrack that are made up by the schools and edited by 
                  the local radio stations. The performances are very good and 
                  the costumes and sets well put together.<br>
                  <br>
                  Each event is generally very well supported by local authorities 
                  including the police. Local radio stations also help to raise 
                  awareness of the initiative and a panel of professional judges 
                  are there to assess the performances.<br>
                  <br>
                  In addition to the main winner there are a number of prizes 
                  such as &#147;Best Concept&#148; and &#147;Best Set Design&#148; 
                  . The sponsors representatives line up on the stage for the 
                  presentations so each of us have had our moments in a packed 
                  theatre going to the microphone and presenting the prize in 
                  front of many hundreds of people.<br>
                  <br>
                  Congratulations go to all schools who have taken part in this 
                  years competition, especially to the Northern and Southern Champions 
                  - Ashfield Girls High School from Belfast and King Richard School 
                  from Portsmouth.<br>

                  The major multi-denominational Christian festivals, took place 
                  this year at Minehead and Skegness &#150; Ansvar&#146;s sponsorship 
                  was behind a series of seminars dealing with drug prevention, 
                  rehabilitation and education, which were attended by nearly 
                  1,400 people.<br>
                  <br>
                  Ansvar supported this initiative by funding the running costs 
                  of the seminar speakers of the Evangelical Coalition on Drugs 
                  (ECOD) and also the administrative costs of another partnership 
                  organisation Hope UK, a Christian charity working to promote 
                  drug-free lifestyles.<br>
                  <br>
                  A fundamental purpose of these seminars was to facilitate a 
                  network of speakers and expertise to spread the message at local 
                  level through churches and Christian organisations. Early evaluation 
                  indicates that this objective is certainly being achieved.<br>

                  is no doubt that sponsorship of this nature helps to raise our 
                  profile within important niche markets. But more important for 
                  us is the opportunity to use our ethical stance to support projects
