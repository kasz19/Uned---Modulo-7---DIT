      <p class="bodySmall">*p.a. rates do not include any cash handling fees or 
        charges</p>
      <p>3.2 We charge a handling fee of 1.5% of the amount of each Cash Advance 
        (minimum fee &pound;1.50 ) 
      <p> 3.3 In calculating the APRs we have not taken into account any changes 
        which we may make to the interest rates, the handling [or annual] fee 
        or any other charges which we may introduce or vary at any time by giving 
        you notice under condition 11. The APRs are calculated on the basis of 
        a Credit Limit of &pound;1,000. At the end of any Special Promotion Period, 
        the standard rate will apply. </p>
      <p> <span class="bodyBold">4.REPAYMENTS AND INTEREST CHARGING</span> 
      <p> 4.1 Each month you must pay at least the minimum payment shown on your 
        statement so that it reaches your Account on or before the Payment Date, 
        which is 19 days after your statement date. The minimum payment will be 
        the greater of &pound;5, or 3% of the Statement Balance or the full Statement 
        Balance, if the Statement Balance is less than &pound; 5. 
      <p> 4.2 If the full Statement Balance shown on your monthly statement reaches 
        your Account on or before the Payment Date, no interest will be charged 
        on that Statement Balance after the date of that statement. 
      <p>If the full Statement Balance shown on your current monthly statement 
        reaches your Account on or before the Payment Date <span class="bodyBold">AND</span> the full Statement 
        Balance which was outstanding on the immediately preceding monthly statement 
        reached your Account on or before the Payment Date shown on that statement, 
        we will not charge interest on any Transactions and Charges shown on your 
        current statement. 
      <p>In all other cases, interest will be charged on a daily basis on the 
        Account Balance on all Balance Transfers, Cheques and Charges from the 
        Posting Date, and on all Cash Advances and Purchases (other than Cheques) 
        from the Transaction Date, up to and including the next statement date 
        when interest will be added to your Account until you have paid the amount 
        you owe us in full. 
      <p> 4.3 Any payment to us will only take effect and be treated as having 
        reached your Account when we can use it to reduce the Account Balance. 
        We will apply payments against the Account Balance in the following order: 
      <p>(a) first against the amount you owe us for Charges; and then against<br>
        (b) Cash Advances and Purchases (in that order) which have been charged 
        to the Account and shown in a statement; followed by<br>
        (c) Cash Advances and Purchases (in that order) which have been charged 
        to the Account but have not yet been shown in a statement. 
      <p>For these purposes, Special Promotions will be treated as:<br>
      <ul>
        (i) Cash Advances, if the interest rate which applied to any Special Promotion 
        during the Special Promotion Period was the same as the rate applicable 
        to Cash Advances; and<br>
        (ii) Purchases, if the interest rate which applied to any Special Promotion 
        during the Special Promotion Period was the same as the rate applicable 
        to Purchases (even if the same rate applied to Cash Advances). <br>
      </ul>
      <p>4.4 We may at our discretion let you pay less than the minimum payment 
        explained in condition 4.1 or make no minimum payment for a particular 
        month or period. If we do this, we will continue to charge interest and 
        add it to the Account as normal. 
      <p>4.5 You must pay us straight away: 
      <ul>
        <li>the amount by which the Account Balance is over the Credit Limit; 
        <li>the amount of any Transaction made in breach of this Agreement; and 
        <li> the amount of any late payment. 
      </ul>
      <p>4.6 Depending on any legal requirements, we can ask for all amounts unpaid 
        under this Agreement to be paid in full if you:<br>
        (a) act fraudulently, frequently break this Agreement or break an important 
        term; <br>
        (b) become bankrupt, or an application for an interim order is made against 
        you under section 253 of the Insolvency Act 1986; or<br>
        (c) die.<br>
      </p>
      <p><span class="bodyBold">5.USING THE CARD AND CHEQUES</span></p>
      <p>5.1 You must sign your Card as soon as you receive it and follow any 
        reasonable instructions that we give about using Cards and keeping them 
        safe. </p>
      <p>5.2 You and any Additional Cardholder can use Cards and you can use Cheques 
        up to the Credit Limit but the Cash Balance must not go over the Cash 
        Limit. When deciding whether you have gone over the Credit Limit or the 
        Cash Limit we take account of the amount of any Transaction we are aware 
        of but have not yet put on the Account. If we authorise a Transaction 
        which takes you over your Credit Limit you will still have to pay an over 
        limit fee as set out in the Tariff.</p>
      <p>5.3 If you ask us to make a Balance Transfer, you will still have to 
        pay any amounts you owe to the lender before and, if necessary, after 
        we add the Balance Transfer to your Account.</p>
      <p>5.4 We will convert all Transactions in foreign currency into sterling 
        using the exchange rate set by the Card Scheme and a conversion fee, set 
        out in the Tariff, on the amount of the Transaction. As rates change, 
        the exchange rate used may not be the same as the rate on the date when 
        the Transaction was made.</p>
      <p>5.5 We do not always issue Cheques or give them to all cardholders. If 
        we send Cheques to you, you must not use them to pay off any amounts you 
        owe us or to make payments in foreign currencies.</p>
      <p>5.6 We will replace the Card from time to time. A replacement Card will 
        either be the same as your existing Card or another Card that you then 
        qualify for and which is covered by this Agreement. </p>
      <p>5.7 Cards and Cheques belong to us. We can ask you and retailers (and 
        others) who have the Card for the purpose of a Transaction to return it 
        to us at any time.</p>
      <p>5.8 After you have made a Purchase with a Card, we cannot stop payment 
        to the retailer or the charging of that Purchase to the Account. If you 
        dispute the Purchase, the retailer must be able to prove that you authorised 
        the Purchase to be charged to the Account. You can ask us to stop a Purchase 
        made by a Cheque as long as you do so before it has been processed by 
        us and the Cheque was not guaranteed.<br>
      </p>
      <p><span class="bodyBold">6.STATEMENTS</span></p>
      <p>We will normally send you a statement once a month. The statement will 
        show the payments you have made and all amounts we have added to your 
        Account since the last statement.</p>
      <p><span class="bodyBold">7.SECURITY</span></p>
      <p>7.1 You must do all that you reasonably can to keep the Card and Cheques 
        safe and the PIN secret at all times. If the Card is a cheque guarantee 
        card, you must keep the Card separate from any Sainsbury's Bank cheques.</p>
      <p>7.2 You must never allow anyone else to use your Card.</p>
      <p>7.3 You must never write the PIN on the Card or on anything you usually 
        keep with it. You must make sure that any written record of your PIN is 
        unrecognisable.</p>
      <p>7.4 You must only reveal the Card number to make a Transaction or to 
        tell us (or a card protection agency) about the loss or theft of the Card.</p>
      <p>7.5 You can only give the PIN to an Additional Cardholder.</p>
      <p><span class="bodyBold">8.NOTICES</span></p>
      <p>8.1 You must give us notice as soon as you can if:</p>
      <p>(a) the Card or Cheques are lost or stolen or you think that they may 
        be misused, or that someone other than an Additional Cardholder may know 
        the PIN;</p>
      <p>(b)your statement includes an item which you think is wrong; or</p>
      <p>(c) you change your address, or you or an Additional Cardholder change 
        name.</p>
      <p>You can contact us on the telephone number or at the address given in 
        condition 1. We may ask you to confirm in writing within seven days any 
        information, which you have not already given us in writing.</p>
      <p>8.2 You must give us all the information you have about the loss, theft 
        or misuse of a Card or Cheques or the PIN, and any other related information 
        which we think will assist us. We may give the police any information 
        we think will be useful. If you find Cards and Cheques which you have 
        reported as lost, stolen or at risk of misuse, you must not use them. 
        You must cut them in half and return them to us immediately at the address 
        shown in condition 1.</p>
      <p><span class="bodyBold">9.LIMITS OF LIABILITY</span></p>
      <p>9.1 You will not be responsible for any Transaction not authorised by 
        you or an Additional Cardholder if the Transaction is made using the Card 
        number when you are not present (eg. by post, telephone, internet). In 
        all other cases, you will be liable for up to &pound;50 for any use of 
        the Card by someone other than you or an Additional Cardholder until you 
        give us notice under clause 8.1(a). If someone uses a Card and they got 
        it with your or an Additional Cardholder's permission, you will be liable 
        for all the Transactions which take place before you tell us that it may 
        be misused.</p>
      <p>9.2 We will not be liable to you if we cannot carry out our responsibilities 
        under this Agreement as a result of anything that we cannot reasonably 
        control. This includes any machine failing to work and industrial disputes. 
        If we cannot produce or send a statement we will use your normal monthly 
        statement date to work out the Payment Date and interest you have to pay 
        on the Account.</p>
      <p><span class="bodyBold">10.REFUNDS AND CLAIMS</span></p>
      <p>We will only credit your Account with a refund for a Transaction if the 
        retailer tells us to. You cannot use a claim you may have against a retailer 
        to make a claim against us or refuse to pay us, unless you have a legal 
        right to do so. You cannot transfer any rights against us to anyone else.</p>
      <p><span class="bodyBold">11.CHANGING THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT</span></p>
      <p>11.1 We may change the terms of this Agreement at any time by telling 
        you about the change. We may make changes to take account of Special Promotions; 
        market conditions; changes in the cost of providing this service to you; 
        changes or anticipated changes in legal or other requirements affecting 
        us; any systems or product development or the introduction of new products 
        or services; or any other good reason.</p>
      <p>We may also introduce a charge for any service provided under or in connection 
        with this Agreement.</p>
      <p>11.2 We will tell you about any changes in one or more of the following 
        ways:</p>
      <p>(a) advertising in the press;</p>
      <p>(b) putting messages in your monthly statement; or</p>
      <p>(c) sending you a separate written notice.</p>
      <p>Changes will happen at least thirty days after we tell you about them, 
        apart from changes in the interest rate and changes which are clearly 
        to your advantage (such as changes for Special Promotions) which may apply 
        immediately. All notices and notice periods will follow the Consumer Credit 
        Act 1974.</p>
      <p><span class="bodyBold">12.LIMITING YOUR RIGHT TO USE THE CARD AND CHEQUES</span></p>
      <p>12.1 If we have a good reason, we may (without warning):</p>
      <p>(a) refuse to authorise a Transaction;</p>
      <p>(b) cancel or suspend your right, or an Additional Cardholder 's right, 
        to use the Card or Cheques for any or all purposes; or</p>
      <p>(c) refuse to replace any Card and Cheques.</p>
      <p>This Agreement will continue even if we do any of these things.</p>
      <p>12.2 We will not be liable:</p>
      <p>(a) if we do not authorise a Transaction;</p>
      <p>(b) if you or an Additional Cardholder cannot use the Card for a Transaction 
        or a Cheque; or</p>
      <p>(c) for any loss or damage you or any Additional Cardholder suffer as 
        a result of the way you are told this.</p>
      <p>12.3 You may not use your Card as payment for any illegal purchase.</p>
      <p><span class="bodyBold">13.ENDING THIS AGREEMENT</span></p>
      <p>This Agreement will end if you or we have given written notice to the 
        other and you have returned all Cards and Cheques and made all payments 
        due under this Agreement. Unless there are exceptional circumstances we 
        will give you thirty days' notice before we end this Agreement. We will 
        not refund any annual fees when the Agreement ends.</p>
      <p><span class="bodyBold">14.ADDITIONAL CARDHOLDERS</span></p>

        CAREFULLY <br>YOUR RIGHTS</span></div>
        The Consumer Credit Act 1974 covers this Agreement and lays 
        down certain requirements for your protection which must be satisfied 
        when the Agreement is made. If they are not, we cannot enforce the Agreement 
        against you without a court order.<br>
        The Act also gives you a number of rights. You have a right to settle 
        this Agreement at any time by giving notice in writing and paying off 
        all amounts payable under the Agreement. If you have obtained unsatisfactory 
        goods or services under a transaction financed by this Agreement, apart 
        from any purchased out of a cash loan, you may have a right to sue the 
        supplier, us or both. Similarly, if the contract is not fulfilled, perhaps 
        because the supplier has gone out of business, you may still be able to 
        sue us.<br>
        If you would like to know more about the protection and remedies provided 
        under the Act, you should contact either your local Trading Standards 
        Department or your nearest Citizens' Advice Bureau.<br>
      <p><span class="bodyBold">LOSS OR MISUSE OF YOUR CARD</span><br>
        If your Card is lost, stolen or misused by someone who obtained it without 
        your consent, you may be liable for up to &pound;50 of any loss to us. 
        If it is misused with your permission you will probably be liable for 
        ALL losses. You will not be liable for losses to us which take place after 
        you have told us of the theft, etc.</p>
      <p>You will not be responsible for a Transaction not authorised by you or 
        an Additional Cardholder if the Transaction is made using the Card number 
        when you are not present (e.g. by post, telephone or internet).<br>
      </p>
      <p><span class="bodyBold">YOUR RIGHT TO CANCEL</span><br>
        Once you have signed, you will have for a short time a right to cancel 
        this Agreement. You can do this by sending or taking a WRITTEN notice 
        of cancellation to: Sainsbury's Bank, Card Services, Pitreavie Business 
        Park, Dunfermline, Fife KY99 4BS.<br>
        If you cancel this Agreement, any money you have paid, goods given in 
        part-exchange (or their value) and property given as security must be 
        returned to you. You will still have to repay any money lent to you. But 
        if you repay all of it before your first instalment is due - or, if you 
        are not paying by instalments, within one month after cancellation - you 
        will not have to pay interest or other charges.<br>
        Any goods which you already have under the Agreement, apart from any purchased 
        out of a cash loan, will have to be returned. Such goods should not be 
        used and should be kept safe. (Legal action may be taken against you if 
        you do not take proper care of them.) You can wait for them to be collected 
        from you and you need not hand them over unless you receive a written 
        request. If you wish, however, you may return the goods yourself.<br>
        You will not, however, be required to hand back any goods supplied to 
        meet an emergency or which have already been incorporated, for example 
        in your home. But you will still be liable to pay for emergency goods 
        or services or for any goods which have been incorporated by you or one 
        of your relatives.</p>
